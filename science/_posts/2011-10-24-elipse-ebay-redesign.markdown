# Elipse E-Bay Redesign

Since my ARTS2 got destroyed in a lawn-dart accident in May, I purchased a Raven2 from Featherweight
Aerospace. No two altimeters have the same mounting points, so I've been modifying the sled to accept
the new altimeter. In the process, I'm re-wiring the bay for quicker setup and altimeter swapping. I
got several 2-pin Molex connectors from Radio Shack / Fry's and have been soldering together a wiring
harness.
