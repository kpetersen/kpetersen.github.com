# Chicken & Dumplings
This is one of Scott's favorite recipes. It's one that his mom used to make for him when he still lived at home, so it brings back
warm, fuzzy memories (my words, not his, as he'd think himself less manly if he said that). It's a wonderful dish on a cold night, 
and it is a great dish to take to someone who is feeling a bit under the weather, just had a baby, or just really likes it when 
someone else cooks for them. 

## Ingredients 
1. 3-4 chicken breasts that have been trimmed
1. about 1 cup of carrots, sliced/thinly chopped 
1. about 1/3 cup of celery, sliced/thinly chopped
1. 2 32-oz boxes of chicken broth
1. 1 can CHEAP biscuits with butter chips
1. some flour

## Directions
1. Boil the chicken breasts in water until fully-cooked. 
1. While boiling the chicken, cut up the biscuits into eight pieces each and roll in flour.
1. When the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and shred it. Empty the water and fill the pot with the chicken broth. Bring to a boil.
1. Once the broth is boiling, dump the biscuit pieces into the pot and boil for 10-12 minutes (until they are cooked).
1. While cooking the biscuits, cook the carrots and celery in water in a different, smaller pot.
1. When the biscuits are done, drain the cooked veggies and add them to the broth. Add the shredded chicken. Boil for two to three
minutes, stirring frequently to mix everything up nicely.
**Flour can be added a bit at a time to thicken the broth to a desired consistency.**
1. Enjoy!!!!
