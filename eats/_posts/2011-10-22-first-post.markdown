# Macaroni & Cheese
We absolutely love macaroni and cheese. Katie is kind of a snob about it, though. 
She doesn't much care for things like meat, bread crumbs, or stinky cheese in her
dish. Scotty completely agrees on the bread crumbs and stinky cheese, though he's 
far more open to the idea of meat in his food (he claims he didn't get to the top of
the food chain to be a vegetarian). Anyway, after years and years of practice, we've
finally created a macaroni and cheese recipe that is both yummy and super-easy, both
of which we consider to be incredibly important in a staple dish such as this. 

## Ingredients
1. 8 oz macaroni noodles (big or small, doesn't matter)
1. PAM (or some other non-stick cooking spray)
1. 8 oz shredded cheese (we like HEB's Mexican Blend without jalapenos)
1. 1 1/4 cup milk (preferably not fat-free; 1% is OK, though)
1. 1 teaspoon salt
1. 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions
1. Boil the noodles for eight minutes in a pot of water on the stove. Remove and drain.
1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
1. Grease a baking dish (I like to use a round Corningware dish, but a square casserole dish will work just fine as well)
with the non-stick spray.
1. Place HALF of the shredded cheese in the bottom of the baking dish.
1. Pour the noodles over the cheese.
1. Add the other half of the shredded cheese to the top of the noodles.
1. Sprinkle the noodles and cheese with the salt and pepper.
1. Pour the milk over everything and stir well so that everything gets nice and mixed together.
1. Place dish in the oven for 25-30 minutes. **Halfway through the baking process, remove the 
dish from the oven and stir everything really well again. This makes sure that everything 
bakes nice and evenly.**
1. Arguably the most important step: ENJOY!!
