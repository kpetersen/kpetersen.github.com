# Lemon Chicken
While flipping through one of her mom's magazines one day, Katie found a recipe for 
lemon-herb chicken. We tried it and liked it -- mostly, so we kept playing with it until
we found a recipe that we really love. This particular recipe seems to go incredibly well with 
baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli. We really aren't sure why... it just is what it is!

## Ingredients (for two people)
1. 2-3 chicken breasts that have been cut into strips (you can also use a package of
chicken strips)
1. 2 Tbsp + 2 Tbsp olive oil (to be honest, I don't really measure)
1. 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
1. 1 Tbsp lemon juice
1. 1 Tbsp lemon zest
1. 1/2+ tsp Italian seasoning

## Directions
1. Saute the chicken in a skillet in 2 Tbsp of the olive oil for about five minutes (until they are fully cooked).
1. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep it warm on a plate.
1. Reduce the heat a bit and add the garlic to the skillet and cook for about two minutes, stirring frequently. Make sure you don't burn the garlic... it cooks quickly.
1. Stir in the other 2 Tbsp of olive oil, the lemon juice, the lemon zest, and the Italian seasoning. Stir until it is well-mixed.
1. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve. Mmmmm!
