# Chicken Stew - CrockPot Recipe!
We experienced the hottest summer on record this year, which put a lot of soup and stew recipes on the back burner for quite some
time. Thankfully, the much-anticipated, much-prayed for, much-welcomed cooler weather finally arrived, reuniting us once again 
with some beloved cooler-weather recipes. This particular one happens to be a throw-together meal (those are big in both of our families because it means they are easy but taste oh-so-good) that Katie's mom used to make
frequently when Katie still lived at home. It's an easy recipe, and you can add or subtract ingredients based on your personal
preferences to create your own perfect stew. 

## Ingredients
1. 1 package of chicken breasts cut into large bite-size pieces
1. 1/2 bag of new potatoes, quartered
1. 1/2 to 1 bag of baby carrots (depends on how much you like carrots, I suppose. We usually use about 3/4 of a bag)
1. Chopped onion and celery (we are lazy, so we buy HEB's little tub of pre-chopped onion and celery and use the whole thing. I suspect
it adds up to about 1/2 of a small white onion and three or four stalks of celery)
1. 2 cans of chopped green chilies 
1. 1 15-oz can of diced tomatoes with their juice
1. 1 box of chicken broth (the 32-oz size)

## Directions
1. Put the chicken in the bottom of the CrockPot.
1. Spread the potatoes on top of the chicken.
1. Put the carrots on top of the potatoes.
1. Spread the onion and celery over the carrots.
1. Pour the two cans of chilies (with their juices) over the onion and celery.
1. Pour the can of tomatoes (again with the juice) over the growing pile of yumminess.
1. Pour the chicken broth over everything, put the lid on the CrockPot, and set the heat. If you are going to be home, it cooks
best at 4 hours on "High" followed by 3-4 hours on "Low." If you are going to be gone all day, it needs to cook on "Low" for at least 
9 hours. Bon apetit!
