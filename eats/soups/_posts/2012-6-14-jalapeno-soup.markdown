# Creamy Jalapeno Soup
Don't let the name of this soup scare you -- it's not too spicy, and it's oh-so-delicious!! 

NOTE: The first few bites, you think to yourself, "Hmm... this needs something," but then, after a few more bites, you think, "Huh, maybe 
not. This is really, really good." I am still considering shredded chicken in it, though -- I'll test it out and let you know what I think. 

## Ingredients (4 servings)
1. 8 oz fresh jalapeno peppers
1. 1 cup milk
1. 1/4 cup butter
1. 1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1. 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1. 1/4 cup flour
1. 3 cups hot chicken broth
1. 2 T fresh lime juice
1. 1 cup chopped cilantro
1. 1 1/2 cup hot milk
1. ground cumin, salt and pepper to taste
1. 3/4 cup hot heavy cream
1. chopped cilantro
1. crisp-fried tortilla strips

## Directions
1. Seed, devein and chop the jalapeno peppers. Soak them in 1 cup milk for 30 minutes. 
1. Melt the butter in a heavy 5-quart saucepan. 
1. Drain the peppers and add to the saucepan with the onion and garlic. Saute until the onion is tender but not brown. 
1. Add the flour and cook 3-4 minutes (or until bubbly), stirring constantly. 
1. Whisk in the hot chicken broth and cook until thickened, whisking constantly. 
1. Whisk in the lime juice and 1 cup cilantro. 
1. Use your immersion blender in the soup until it's smooth. 
1. Add 1 1/2 cups hot milk to the puree. Heat just to simmering.
1. Season with cumin, salt and pepper. 
1. Right before you serve, add 3/4 cup hot heavy cream and stir. 
1. Garnish with cilantro and tortilla strips. Mmmm!
