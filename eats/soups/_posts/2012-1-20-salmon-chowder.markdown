# Salmon Chowder
This recipe is adapted from a _Better Homes and Gardens Special Interest Publications: SOUPS_ magazine I found at the store. It's absolutely delicious and very healthy as it's full of yummy vegetables. 

## Ingredients (for about six hearty servings)
1. 2 Tbsp butter
1. 1 16-oz package of frozen vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower mix)
1. 1 16-oz package of frozen vegetables (corn, green beans, carrots, lima beans mix)
1. 2 fresh jalapenos, seeds removed and then finely chopped
1. 4 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1. 4 cups low-fat milk
1. 2 cups half-and-half
1. 1 28-oz package of frozen hash browns with peppers and onions, thawed
1. 2 14.5-oz cans of cooked salmon, drained, flaked and bones/cartilage removed (this takes a while and is kind of messy)
1. 4 Tbsp lemon juice
1. 3/4 tsp salt
1. 1 tsp black pepper

## Directions
1. In a large pot, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it is melted. 
1. Stir in the frozen vegetables and the jalapenos; cook until tender. (This takes a while so be patient.)
1. Add the flour to the mixture and stir until it's nicely combined with the vegetables. 
1. Add the milk and half-and-half. Cook, stirring, until the soup begins to bubble. Cook for one more minute, still stirring.
1. Add the hash browns, salmon, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Stir to get everything combined and heated all the way through.
1. Serve with a nice, crusty bread like a baguette.
