# Baby Back Ribs - Crock Pot Recipe!
Scott makes the best ribs I've ever had, hands-down. He slow-cooks them on the grill for HOURS, and the flavor... oooh! They're a little sweet and a little spicy. I just love it. I keep bugging him to put his rib recipe up here, but he hasn't done it yet (obviously). I, on the other 
hand, refuse to learn how to use our grill because I am afraid that if I do, Scotty won't keep grilling for me. :) That being said, last weekend I thawed some ribs I'd gotten on sale and frozen, hoping Scott would throw them 
on the grill on Sunday and we'd have a delicious feast later that evening. Well, we ended up having plans on Sunday that didn't allow us to cook the ribs, and I didn't want them to go to waste. Knowing Scotty wouldn't have 
time after work to grill the ribs, I did the next best thing: I threw those babies in a Crock Pot. YUM! I tried to recreate Scott's sweet and spicy ribs and did a pretty decent job with minimal ingredients. As for the soda, I heard somewhere that Dr. Pepper is a great liquid to add to meat in the Crock Pot, and I didn't have any so I thought 
I'd try some Coke. I kid you not... we reached in with a pair of tongs to pick up the rack of ribs and the bones literally fell out of the 
meat. That's how tender these ribs were. While I still prefer Scott's ribs, these are DEFINITELY a fantastic week-night option! Oh, and the house smelled FANTASTIC all day long. :)

## Ingredients 
1. 1 rack of baby back ribs (extra meaty if you can find them)
1. 1 T garlic powder
1. 1 heaping tsp black pepper
1. 1/2 cup brown sugar
1. 1/2 can of Coca-Cola
1. 1/2 cup BBQ sauce (I like Central Market True Texas Organic BBQ Sauce, which I find at HEB)

## Directions
1. Cut your rack of ribs in half. 
1. Mix the garlic powder, black pepper, and brown sugar together in a bowl and rub it over the ribs generously on both sides. 
1. Place ribs in the Crock Pot (it's okay -- they'll have to kind of stack on each other).
1. Pour the soda over the ribs. 
1. Cover and cook on high for 8-9 hours. For the last thirty minutes of cooking, pour the BBQ sauce over the ribs. YUM!
