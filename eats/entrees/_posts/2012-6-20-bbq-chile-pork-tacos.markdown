# BBQ Green Chile Pork Tacos
Do you ever find yourself with leftover ribs thinking, "Wow! I really don't want the same thing I had for dinner last night again tonight, but I am out of good BBQ ribs sides"? I have a solution to your problem! Who would have 
thought that BBQ ribs would make EXCELLENT green chile pork tacos? Not this girl. However, one night, Scott and I had leftover ribs and no idea what to do with them. With a little creativity (Scott is always willing to try 
something new in the kitchen -- YAY!), Scotty created a delicious pork taco recipe that I can't wait to share with you!!

## Ingredients 
1. Leftover ribs, meat removed from bones and fork-shredded
1. 1 can chopped green chiles (mild)
1. 1/3 to 1/2 can Hatch Green Chile Enchilada Sauce (we get the Hatch brand because most store-brands have MSG in them)
1. water (about 1/3 cup)
1. soft corn tortillas
1. fresh cilantro, chopped
1. fresh onions, chopped

## Directions
1. In a saucepan, mix the rib meat, chopped chiles, the enchilada sauce, and the water. 
1. Place saucepan over medium-low heat and, stirring frequently, bring to a simmer. 
1. Allow the meat to simmer, stirring frequently because otherwise it will burn to the bottom of the pan, for about twenty minutes. If it begins to dry out, you can add a little more enchilada sauce and/or water. 
1. Serve in warm corn tortillas topped with fresh, chopped cilantro and onion. YUM!
