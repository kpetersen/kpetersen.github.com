# Katie's (almost) World-Famous Fried Chicken
We love fried chicken in this household, and nothing beats good 'ole homemade fried chicken fresh out of the frying pan. I've been working on this recipe for several years now, adding and subtracting ingredients until I found the 
perfect level of spice and the perfect crunchy coating for the chicken. I think I've finally achieved perfection, though. It's a fairly messy dish, this fried chicken, but it's completely worth it in the end. I didn't really want 
to put this recipe up here (if everyone knows how to make it, no one will come over for dinner anymore, right??) but Scotty insisted, saying it's one of my best and that it should be shared. So, here it is... I hope you all like it!

## Ingredients (this is for 2-3 people... a really full package of chicken strips could probably feed 4, though)
1. 1 package of chicken strips, trimmed of the fat
1. 1 bottle of buttermilk (get the bigger one)
1. [Jim's Killer Seasoning](http://worldsmyoyster.com/eats/appetizers/2011/11/11/killer-seasoning.html)
1. All-purpose flour (several cups)
1. Canola oil (most of a bottle)

## Directions
1. Sprinkle both sides of each chicken strip with Jim's Killer Seasoning and place the strips in a large plastic bag.
1. Fill the plastic bag with buttermilk so that all of the strips are completely covered. If you have any extra buttermilk, do not throw it out. You'll want it later!
1. Seal the bag and place it in a bowl (just in case of leaks) in the refrigerator for at least thirty minutes (or up to overnight). 

## When you are ready to cook...
1. Put about 3-4 cups of flour in a clean bowl and season moderately with Jim's Killer Seasoning, stirring so it's well-mixed. (I put enough that I can see it in the flour... several heaping spoonfuls.)
1. Pour the buttermilk (both that which is in the bag of chicken and any leftover you might have had) into a second bowl.
1. Go ahead and heat up your oil. You need a nice, deep frying pan, and you want enough oil in there to cover the strips completely. I've found that doing this means you don't have to turn the strips very often, giving your fried 
coating a much better chance at maintaining its togetherness. Get the oil hot enough that it pops like crazy when you drop a tiny bit of water in it. (Get your hand a bit wet, then just shake it over the pan to get a few drops in there.)
1. For each chicken strip: gently shake any excess buttermilk from the strip, dredge it in the flour mixture, dip it in the buttermilk, and dredge again, taking care to really get as much flour to stick to the strip each time you dredge it.
1. Gently place the chicken strips in the oil, taking care not to lose any more of the flour than you have to. Do not stack the strips on top of each other. This will result in soggy fried chicken. If you have to do it in batches, you can keep
the fried chicken warm in the oven.
1. Fry the chicken for about 12 minutes, turning once or twice (after the first five minutes or so) to make sure it cooks nice and evenly. When you think they are getting done, sacrifice an ugly piece by cutting it open to make sure 
the chicken is cooked all the way through. 
1. Remove the chicken strips from the pan gently and place them on a plate lined with paper towels. Blot the tops with another paper towel to remove any excess oil. Enjoy!

**This chicken is FABULOUS cold the next day, right out of the fridge. In fact, that's how I (Katie) prefer it. Scotty prefers it hot, straight out of the frying pan. Either way, it's pretty dang good!**
