# Your Basic Meatloaf
This is one of those meals people seem to either love or hate. Personally, I love a good meatloaf, and I don't want to see a lot of tomatoes, etc. in it. Below, you'll find an easy and pretty simple recipe for your basic meatloaf.

## Ingredients
1. 1 egg
1. 3-5 squirts Ketchup
1. 1/4 cup oatmeal
1. 1 Lipton Onion Soup mix (dry)
1. 1 lb. ground beef

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
1. Mix the first four ingredients together with a fork in a large bowl.
1. Add the ground beef and mix well. (As much as my hands end up aching from the cold, I use my hands to mix this because I think it mixes better than trying to do it with a potato masher, fork, etc.)
1. Place in an ungreased loaf pan and bake for about an hour.
