# Granny D Eggs
Katie is the complete opposite of a stress eater. In fact, when she's ill or feeling blue, she frequently doesn't eat much at all, citing a loss of appetite. One of the few things that she 
will eat is a Granny D Egg, an old family recipe for poached eggs from her mom's side of the family. It's a nice and bland egg dish that soothes an upset stomach and goes down fabulously 
with a nice glass of ginger ale. 

## Ingredients 
1. 2 eggs
1. 6-8 saltine crackers
1. 1 pat of butter
1. salt and pepper to taste
1. water

## Directions
1. Boil the water in a pot. 
1. Crumble the crackers into a bowl (like a cereal bowl). Add butter, salt and pepper to the crackers (you don't have to mix it in yet).
1. Poach the eggs.  (To poach an egg, crack it into boiling water and let it cook until the whites are solid, about three minutes.)
1. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon and add them to the bowl. Mix/mash together well. Enjoy!
