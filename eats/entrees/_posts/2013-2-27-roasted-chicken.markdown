# Oven-Roasted Chicken
This is the juiciest chicken I've ever had, and the sauce for pouring over the chicken and veggies is incredible. YUM!

## Ingredients 
1. 3-4 pound whole chicken
1. 1 tsp garlic powder
1. 1 tsp salt
1. 1 tsp black pepper
1. 3 tbsp butter
1. 4 sprigs fresh thyme
1. 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
1. 1 yellow onion, quartered
1. 1 bag of baby carrots
1. 2.5-3 pounds new potatoes, cut into fourths or sixths depending on how big your potatoes are
1. 1 lemon, quartered
1. 6 cloves garlic, peeled 
1. 1/4 to 1/2 cup white wine (I like chardonnay) or light beer (something like Blue Moon, Shiner, etc. would work well)

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. 
1. Wash and trim any fat from your chicken and remove all of the inside parts.
1. Combine garlic powder, salt, and pepper and rub all over your chicken. 
1. In a 5 1/2 quart (or larger) Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the thyme and rosemary and let sit for about thirty seconds so the flavors
meld. 
1. Add the chicken, breast down, and brown for about four minutes. Use tongs to flip your chicken over and brown on the other side for six minutes. 
1. Add the potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, and lemon around the chicken, then place the lid on the pot. 
1. Bake in oven for one to one and a half hours (until thermometer reads 165 degrees all over). 
1. Transfer chicken to a platter and tent (or have someone else start slicing it while you deal with the sauce!). 
1. Scoop the veggies into a bowl with a slotted spoon, removing the thyme and rosemary stems and lemons. 
1. Place the Dutch oven back on a burner and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the wine or beer and cook until reduced and thickened a bit, 5-8 minutes. 
Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper if desired. Serve drizzled over the chicken and vegetables, or in a bowl on the table so people can add however much 
they want.
