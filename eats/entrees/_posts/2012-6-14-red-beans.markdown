# Red Beans and Ham (to be served with corn bread) - Crock Pot Recipe!
This, along with the [Granny D Eggs](http://worldsmyoyster.com/eats/entrees/2011/11/16/grannyd.html) qualifies as ultimate comfort food for me. It's very Southern, so my dad struggles a bit with it and requires some ham on the side (HA!), 
but the rest of my family likes it as-is. I prefer to crumble my corn bread right into the bowl with the beans and mash it up together, whereas Scotty prefers to eat his cornbread on the side. However you choose to eat it is completely
up to you -- I just hope you love it as much as I do!

## Ingredients 
1. 1 bag of dried pinto beans, soaked overnight then rinsed, drained, and with any rocks, etc. removed (I know that sounds gross, but seriously -- look next time you soak beans! I bet you find a rock or two mixed in there!)
1. 1 onion, chopped
1. 1 can chopped green chilies
1. 1 hamsteak, chopped

## Directions
1. Place the beans in your crock pot. 
1. Add the chopped onion, chopped green chilies, and chopped ham to the pot. 
1. Fill pot with water so that there's 1/2 to 1 inch of water above the beans. 
1. Cook on high for 8+ hours and enjoy with a side of corn bread. Mmmmm!
