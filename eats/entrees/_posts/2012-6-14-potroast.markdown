# Pot Roast and Veggies - Crock Pot Recipe!
My mom is the queen of Crock Pot recipes; she can cook anything in one of those electric pots and it's all delicious. This is one of the meals she used to make quite frequently when we were kids, and it's scrumdiddlyumptious 
(and super-easy). 

## Ingredients 
1. 3-4 lb rump roast
1. 1/2 bag (or more) new potatoes
1. 1 bag of baby carrots
1. 1 tub of HEB chopped celery and onion

## Directions
1. Remove roast from packaging and trim the fat if necessary. (It's okay -- in fact, it's encouraged -- to have a little fat on the roast, but you don't want very much.)
1. Place roast in crock pot. 
1. Quarter your new potatoes and place those, along with the carrots and onion and celery, in the pot around the roast.
1. Put the lid on the Crock Pot and turn the dial to HIGH. Cook for 8 hours and enjoy!
