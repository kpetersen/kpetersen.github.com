# Pineapple Brown Sugar Ham
Although it's not going to make it on to any diet plan, this juicy, sweet ham is absolutely delicious as a dinner treat now and then. It's also super-easy and takes very little time to prepare and cook, which is always a plus on 
a busy night!

## Ingredients (for two)
1. 1 good-sized hamsteak, fully-cooked
1. 1 small can of pineapple slices in heavy syrup (or you can use a can of the crushed pineapple if you don't want big slices)
1. brown sugar

## Directions
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. 
1. Place the hamsteak in an ungreased baking dish. 
1. Lightly sprinkle brown sugar on top of the ham. 
1. Place 3-4 slices of pineapple on top of the hamsteak (do not stack them). 
1. Pour part of the pineapple "juice" over the hamsteak (I usually use about 3/4 of it). 
1. Place in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. Enjoy!
