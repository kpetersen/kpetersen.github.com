# Buffalo Meatloaf
I'm a big fan of meatloaf (in case you couldn't tell), and I really do make an effort to serve healthy meals here at home on a regular basis, contrary to what you might think after looking at a lot of the 
stuff I have posted here. A year or so ago, my mom gave me a recipe for buffalo meatloaf. I'd been wanting to try something using buffalo because it's naturally low in fat and actually quite good for you, 
particularly compared to ground beef. Mom just wrote out the recipe, so I had no idea where she'd found it. Anyway, a few weeks ago, I was at the grocery store and couldn't remember all of the ingredients for the recipe. Out of desperation, I Google-searched "buffalo meatloaf" and was 
thrilled that I was able to find the recipe Mom had given me. [Here](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ellens-buffalo-meatloaf/) is the recipe I use; it's called "Ellen's Buffalo Meatloaf." It's really, really good
and maintains a nice, juicy tenderness (in other words it's not a really dry meatloaf). I'm also including the recipe below because I am always afraid that a link will disappear and then I'll no longer have 
access to the recipe. 

## Ingredients
1. 1 slice multigrain bread
1. 1 lb ground buffalo meat
1. 1 onion, diced (I'll be honest -- I only use about half of an onion)
1. 1 egg, lightly beaten
1. 1 tsp mustard powder
1. 3/4 can diced tomatoes, drained
1. 1 tsp salt
1. 1 dash ground black pepper (I use more like five or six dashes)
1. 1/3 cup ketchup (I just squirt some in the mix... I don't measure it)

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
1. Crumble the bread slice into crumbs and set aside. (A food processor works great for this!)
1. Grease an 8X8" baking dish. 
1. Thoroughly mix the buffalo meat, onion, egg, ground mustard, tomatoes, salt, pepper, 
and bread crumbs together in a large bowl. 
1. Form he meat mixture into a loaf shape about 8X4" and place in the middle of the 
baking dish. 
1. Apply ketchup to the top and sides of the meatloaf. 
1. Bake in the oven until the meat is no longer pink and ketchup forms a glaze over the 
meatloaf, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
