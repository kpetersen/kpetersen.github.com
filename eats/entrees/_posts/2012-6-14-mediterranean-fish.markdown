# Oven-Roasted Fish
Years ago, I was flipping through a magazine when I found a recipe for oven-roasted fish that sounded absolutely amazing. I cut it out and saved it, determined to try it some day. Today, I can't remember where I found the recipe, 
though I do know that it's from the American Institute for Cancer Research because it says so on my magazine clipping. HA. Anyway, I absolutely love how light and fresh this dish is -- it's perfect for dinner on a summer evening. 

## Ingredients (for four people)
1. 4 pieces white fish (I tend to use tilapia or basa, which is no longer basa and I can't remember the name of it now)
1. 2 garlic cloves, minced
1. 1 tsp lemon juice
1. 2 medium zucchini, trimmed and thinly sliced
1. 1/2 red onion, cut into very thin slivers
1. 1 strip (1/2-inch wide) orange zest -- remove it with a vegetable peeler then cut it into 4 long, narrow strips
1. 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
1. salt and freshly ground black pepper
1. 2 tsp olive oil
1. 2 cups cooked brown rice

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 
1. Cut four pieces of foil, each about twelve inches long. Place a piece of fish in the center of each. 
1. Rub minced garlic on the fish and sprinkle with lemon juice. 
1. Divide the zucchini, red onion, orange zest, and basil evenly among the tops of each piece of fish. 
1. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. 
1. Wrap the foil into packets so that they are completely enclosed. 
1. Place foil packets on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. 
1. When finished, remove foil packets from oven and slide the contents onto a bed of rice. YUM!
