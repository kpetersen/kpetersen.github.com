# Crock Pot Fajitas - Crock Pot Recipe!
This is one of Scott's most favorite recipes. His mom used to make it for him when he lived at home, and in all honesty, it's the only way I'll eat beef fajitas. Usually I find them to be incredibly tough, but after spending 
the day in the Crock Pot, these fajitas fall apart in your mouth. Also, the leftovers make EXCELLENT nachos the next day -- seriously... best nachos ever!

## Ingredients 
1. 1 1/2 lb boneless sirloin steak, cut into strips
1. 2 T vegetable oil
1. 2 T lemon juice
1. 1/8 tsp garlic powder
1. 1 tsp cumin
1. 1/2 tsp seasoned salt
1. 1 T chili powder
1. 1/4 tsp black pepper
1. 1 green onion, cut into strips
1. 1 large onion, sliced

## Directions
1. In a skillet, brown the steak strips in the oil then place strips in the Crock Pot. Leave the oil in the skillet.  
1. Add the lemon juice and seasonings to the vegetable oil and stir thoroughly. Pour over the meat in the Crock Pot. 
1. Cover and cook on high 2-3 hours or low 3-4 hours. 
1. Add the green pepper and onion for the last hour. YUM!
