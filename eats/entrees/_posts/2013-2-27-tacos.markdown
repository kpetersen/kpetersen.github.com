# Chicken Tacos - CrockPot Recipe!
Easy-peasy and delicious chicken taco recipe for those busy days. For four people. 

## Ingredients 
1. 4-5 frozen chicken breasts (or thawed...I just use whatever I have, though I don't mix them...either all frozen or all thawed)
1. 1 1/2 packages McCormick Chicken Taco seasoning
1. salt and pepper to taste
1. box of chicken broth
1. HOT salsa (we like El Fenix)

## Directions
1. Place chicken breasts in the bottom of the CrockPot. 
1. Mix the taco seasoning with salt and pepper and sprinkle over the chicken. 
1. Pour enough chicken broth to fill the bottom of the crock pot with about 1 1/2 inches. 
1. Top with a couple of hearty spoonfuls of salsa. The more you add, the hotter it will be. I generally use about 1/3 cup, sometimes 1/2 cup of salsa, and it 
has a bite but isn't a lingering spiciness. 
1. Cover and cook on low for at least seven hours and shred with a fork. Serve with warm tortillas (we prefer corn). YUM!
