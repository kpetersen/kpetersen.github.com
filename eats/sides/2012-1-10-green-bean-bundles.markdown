# Green Bean Bundles
Scott's mom has yet to make something I don't like, but I am fairly certain that her green bean bundles are my favorite dish. I could eat them all day long and have no regrets, even when standing on a scale the following day. These 
things are DELICIOUS! Seriously... I can't say enough good things about them. You will just have to try them for yourself. They are a little involved, not one of those recipes where you only have to be half-involved for it to 
turn out well. BUT THEY ARE SO GOOD!!!

## Ingredients (serves five people with about four bundles per person)
1. 3-4 cans whole green beans (for reference, each can makes about five bundles)
1. 8-10 slices of raw bacon, cut in halves

## Glaze
1. 3/4 stick butter 
1. 1/2 cup brown sugar
1. 1/8 tsp garlic powder
1. salt and pepper to taste

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
1. Wrap bacon slices around 6-8 beans and put seam side of bacon down in a Pyrex dish. (Seam side down eliminates the need for a toothpick, though if you want to serve these as appetizers rather than as a side, I recommend toothpicks
so it's easy to pick them up.)
1. Melt the glaze ingredients together in a sauce pan and drizzle over the beans and bacon. 
1. Bake, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Watch *carefully* toward the end as the beans tend to burn quickly.
