# Cilantro-Lime Rice
I love rice, but sometimes it needs a little something other than soy sauce or butter. This recipe is so refreshing... the rice is light, fluffy, and has such an amazing flavor. I like to serve it with Mexican dishes (like my 
[chicken enchilada casserole](http://worldsmyoyster.com/eats/entrees/2011/10/24/chicken-enchilada-casserole.html)), but it would go well with pretty much anything, I think. I don't have a rice cooker, so I use Uncle Ben's Boil-in-Bag rice. 

## Ingredients (serves four)
1. 2 bags of boil-in-bag rice (or the equivalent thereof)
1. 4 cups water
1. 4 cups chicken broth
1. 3 tsp vegetable oil
1. 4 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
1. 1/2 of a nice, big lime or 1 little lime, juice only

## Directions
1. In a large pot, bring the water and the chicken broth to a boil.
1. Cook rice in water/broth for ten minutes. Drain the pot, remove rice from bags, and return rice to pot.
1. Add the vegetable oil, cilantro, and lime juice to the rice and stir, mixing everything evenly. 
1. Serve! YUM!
