# Sauteéd Brussels Sprouts with Lemon
I absolutely love Brussels sprouts, though Scotty can take or leave them (mostly leave, I'm afraid). I have found two ways to cook them that he will tolerate, though. This 
is one of those recipes. It's a pretty basic sauté with a bit of lemon to bring out the flavor of the sprouts.  

## Ingredients (for four people)
1. 1 stalk or 1 of those purple mesh bags of Brussels sprouts
1. 3 Tbsp olive oil plus more for drizzle
1. Salt and pepper, to taste
1. Water (maybe 1/4 cup?)
1. some lemon juice (I use about half of a lemon's worth of juice)

## Directions
1. Wash your sprouts and trim off the bottom stem parts. Remove the outer leaves so you have nice, fresh sprouts. Cut each sprout in half. 
1. Heat up 3 Tbsp olive oil in a sauté pan that has a lid (medium heat).
1. Place the sprouts cut-side down in the heated oil, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle a bit more olive oil over the sprouts. 
1. Cover the sprouts and let them cook for about three minutes. 
1. Remove the cover, sprinkle some water on the sprouts, return the cover, and cook for another three minutes. 
1. Remove the cover and stir the sprouts with a spatula. You want them to be caramelized (turning brown on the parts that were facing down). Cook uncovered, stirring, until the sprouts
are fork-tender. 
1. Empty sprouts into a bowl and squeeze the lemon juice over them. 
1. Stir so they are evenly coated and serve hot!
