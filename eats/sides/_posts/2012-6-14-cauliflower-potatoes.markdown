# Cauliflower-Mashed Potatoes
I love trying to sneak vegetables into random things, and I think cauliflower makes mashed potatoes SO creamy. The heavy cream helps, too, but the flavor is just so rich, especially with the thyme (which I grow in my garden). YUM! 

## Ingredients (for four)
1. 1 big head of cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1. 2 small Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1. 2 cups heavy cream
1. 1 clove garlic, chopped
1. 3-4 sprigs fresh thyme
1. salt and white pepper, to taste

## Directions
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the cauliflower, potatoes, heavy cream, garlic, thyme sprigs, salt and pepper over medium-high heat. 
1. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to low to simmer. 
1. Simmer until cauliflower is fork-tender, about twenty minutes. 
1. Remove the thyme and discard. 
1. With a slotted spoon, transfer the solids to a bowl and mash with a fork or potato masher until smooth. You can add some of the cream from the saucepan to get the consistency you want as you mash.
