# Applesauce Apples
Apple are a wonderful treat year-round, but for some reason most people associate them more with fall. More often than not I consider
apples a snack rather than a side dish to accompany a meal. This particular recipe, however, is a wonderful side, particularly with
pork dishes. 

## Ingredients (for four people)
1. 4 apples - do NOT peel them (I like Braeburn because they are a naturally sweet apple)
1. 4 pats of butter
1. cinnamon
1. foil

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees.
1. Core the apples completely so that you have a hole all the way through the center of the apple and no core or seeds left.
1. Place each apple on a piece of foil large enough to wrap completely around the apple and seal at the top.
1. For each apple, slice one pat of butter in half and stack them on top of each other in the hole inside the apple.
1. Sprinkle the top of each apple with some cinnamon, making sure you get a bit down in the hole as well.
1. Wrap the apple in the foil so that the apple is entirely close (it works best if you twist the foil corners together at the top).
1. Place the foil packets on a cookie sheet (in case they leak) and place in the oven for 40 minutes. 

**These apples will be *incredibly* hot when you remove them from the oven, so be sure you unwrap them very carefully!**
