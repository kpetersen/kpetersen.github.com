# Roasted New Potatoes
I've yet to meet a potato I didn't like. I think, perhaps, that a good baked potato (steaming hot, soft all the way through, filled with a little bit of butter, a sprinkling of cheese, and a bit of salt and pepper) might be my 
favorite food. It's a perfect comfort food when you think about it. This recipe is a very close second to the baked potato. I love how easy it is and how little time it takes compared to baking a big potato in the oven. In this 
entry you will actually find two different recipes for roasted new potatoes in hopes of making this a great addition to any main course. 

## Ingredients for Herbed Roasted Potatoes (for two adults)
1. 1/3 bag of new potatoes, quartered (you don't have to peel them)
1. Olive oil
1. Fresh rosemary, removed from stems (2-3 sprigs should suffice)
1. Salt and pepper to taste
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees.
1. Place the quartered potatoes in a mixing bowl or a plastic bag. Add enough olive oil to coat them, the rosemary, and the salt and pepper. Shake or stir the potatoes to evenly coat them.
1. Spray PAM in the bottom of a baking dish. Place the potatoes in the dish so that they lay flat (you don't want the potatoes stacked on one another).
1. Bake for 25 minutes in the oven.

## Ingredients for Spicy Roasted Potatoes (for two adults)
1. 1/3 bag of new potatoes, quartered (you don't have to peel them)
1. Olive oil
1. [Jim's Killer Seasoning]()
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees.
1. Place the quartered potatoes in a mixing bowl or a plastic bag. Add enough olive oil to coat them and sprinkle generously with Jim's Killer Seasoning. Shake or stir the potatoes to evenly coat them.
1. Spray PAM in the bottom of a baking dish. Place the potatoes in the dish so that they lay flat (you don't want the potatoes stacked on one another).
1. Bake for 25 minutes in the oven.

**You can also put the potatoes in a grill basket and grill over direct heat (high) for 45-50 minute (until fork tender). You will need to stir them often to make sure you don't burn your potatoes to the bottom of the basket. When you 
grill them the potatoes get this wonderful crispy skin with a fabulously mushy inside!**
