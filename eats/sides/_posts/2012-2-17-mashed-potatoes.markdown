# Scrumptious Mashed Potatoes
Every year at Thanksgiving, my dad's best friend makes these amazing mashed potatoes. After years and years of trying to duplicate them, 
I finally gave up, accepting that mine were just never going to quite live up to my expectations. Last night, however, my brother requested 
mashed potatoes as a side to accompany our herbed pork loin and Brussels sprouts, so I thought I'd try something new while cooking them. Jim,
my dad's best friend, always mashes his potatoes with about a pound of butter and a several cups of heavy cream (I told you they were good!), 
so I thought to myself, 'Why not boil my potatoes in heavy cream instead?' So that's what we did. DAAAAAANG! They were SO GOOD!

## Ingredients (serves four)
1. 2/3 bag of red potatoes
1. enough heavy cream to cover all of the potatoes in a pot
1. 2-3 Tbsp butter
1. salt and pepper to taste

## Directions
1. Wash and cut your potatoes into quarters then put them in a large pot. 
1. Fill the pot with heavy cream so that the potatoes are just covered. 
1. Bring to a boil and then simmer/low boil the potatoes and cook them for about twenty minutes (until very, very tender). 
1. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon and place them in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the butter and salt and pepper (to taste) to the potatoes and, using your mixer, mash the potatoes together with the butter. 
1. Taste the potatoes and add butter, salt, pepper and, if you so desire, a bit of the cream from the pot, to reach your preferred taste and consistency.
