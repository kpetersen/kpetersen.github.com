# Glazed Carrots
**WARNING: This recipe is not a diet-friendly way to eat carrots!**

I absolutely love vegetables. To be honest with you, I prefer my vegetables in the raw; even when I cook them, I tend to eat them without butter or seasoning. It's just how I like them. Scotty, however, does not share my love for 
naked vegetables, so to keep things interesting, I sometimes make these. My dad used to do this with carrots around the holidays -- it's a perfect fall recipe. A tip for those of you who like brandy: when I say "sprinkle" the carrots
with brandy, I really mean that. One time I put about 1/4 cup of brandy in with the carrots and then we just had soggy carrots. It wasn't my best performance in the kitchen; Scott likens it to the time I added Cumin instead of 
Cinnamon to a blueberry pie...

## Ingredients 
1. Baby carrots or sliced carrots (enough to feed however many people you want to feed)
1. Butter (if you're making this for four people, you will want, at the very least, half a stick of butter and probably more)
1. Brown Sugar
1. Brandy

## Directions
1. Cook the carrots in a skillet in the butter until tender (20-30 minutes, covered, on low heat)
1. Sprinkle the carrots with brown sugar and stir thoroughly to evenly coat the carrots.
1. Sprinkle some brandy over the carrots and simmer until the brandy has reduced and you're left with a buttery, caramely coating on the carrots. MMMMmmmmm!
