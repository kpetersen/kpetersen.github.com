# Bran Muffins
Muffins are wonderful little treats, don't you think? We love blueberry muffins but have to confess that we usually use boxed mixes
for them. They just always seem to turn out sweeter and gooier. THESE muffins, however, are splendid AND home-made. As an added bonus,
they'll, uh, regulate you. How can anyone complain about that??

## Ingredients 
1. 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1. 1 Tbsp baking powder
1. 1/2 tsp salt
1. 1/2 cup sugar
1. 1 1/2 cup bran cereal (we like Kellog's All-Bran)
1. 1 1/4 cup milk
1. 1 egg
1. 1/4 cup vegetable oil
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees.
1. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Set aside.
1. Measure bran cereal and milk into a large mixing bowl and stir to combine. Let stand for 1-2 minutes to soften the cereal.
1. Add the egg and oil to the cereal and milk and beat well. (I use my hand mixer.)
1. Add the flour mixture, stirring only until well-combined. 
1. Portion the batter evenly into 12 **greased** muffin pan cups. 
1. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the muffins test done.
