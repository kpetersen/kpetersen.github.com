# Cinnamon Pull-Apart Bread
Scott and I are blessed to have parents who are exceptional cooks in their own rights. My parents were concerned that I would starve
to death after moving out of the college dorm because I had shown absolutely no interest in the kitchen area of the house my entire
life. (That concern was completely legitimate as I had to call my mom and ask her how to turn on the oven in my first apartment.) I 
don't know if Scott's folks had the same concern for him, but I'm pretty sure his mom wondered a bit about me when, while reading a 
recipe she'd given me, I called and asked her what it meant to "brown" meat. I've since learned that it's far less humiliating to just
look this stuff up [online](http://www.google.com). Thankfully, Scott's mom has continued to give me recipes, presumably because she's
impressed that neither Scott nor I have managed to burn the house down in our kitchen escapades to date. This recipe, Cinnamon Pull-Apart
Bread, is one to which I was introduced at a family brunch. It's absolutely delicious, and I can say for a fact that you won't have to
worry about leftovers if there are very many people at the table that day!

## Ingredients 
1. 3 cans (cheap) buttermilk biscuits
1. 1 cup sugar
1. 3 tsp cinnamon
1. nuts and raisins (optional)
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray
1. 1 stick of butter

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
1. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a bowl.
1. Cut each biscuit into 6 pieces and roll in the cinnamon sugar.
1. Stack the biscuit pieces in a **greased** bundt pan evenly. I suppose if you're going to add nuts and/or raisins, this would be the time to do it. I 
do not like nuts or raisins in breads, so I've never actually put them in this recipe. Just put them in around/between the pieces of 
bread.
1. Sprinkle a bit of the remaining cinnamon sugar over the top of the bread.
1. Melt 1 stick of butter and pour it over the top.
1. Bake for 25-30 minutes and ENJOY!!!
