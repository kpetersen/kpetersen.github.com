# The World's Best Apple Cake
I love apple cake! I particularly love this apple cake as it is incredibly moist and has the best flavor I've ever found in an apple cake. My mom makes this around the holidays, and as the holiday season is quickly approaching, I 
have had this cake on my mind. I can't wait to make it again -- maybe this week?

## Ingredients 
1. 1 1/2 cups canola oil
1. 2 cups sugar
1. 2 eggs
1. 3 cups sifted flour
1. 1 tsp baking soda
1. 2 tsp vanilla
1. 1/2 tsp salt
1. 1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1. 1 tsp cinnamon
1. 3 tart cooking apples (Granny Smith) - peeled, cored, and finely chopped
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees.
1. Combine the oil and sugar then add the eggs and beat well.
1. Blend in the apples and nuts.
1. Combine the dry ingredients in a seperate mixing bowl then add to the blended mixture and stir well.
1. Pour into **two** well-greased loaf pans and bake for 1 1/2 hours. You can also use a single, well-greased bundt pan and bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes. 
1. Check for doneness with a toothpick or straw -- you want it to come out clean when inserted near the middle of the bread.
