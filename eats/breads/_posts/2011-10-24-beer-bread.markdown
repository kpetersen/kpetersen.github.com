# Beer Bread
A few nights ago, we were discussing with some friends how nothing beats the smell of bread baking in the oven (except, perhaps, 
brownies). We began lamenting the fact that most breads take a ridiculous amount of time to make when you consider the kneading, the 
rising, the kneading, the rising, the baking... Anyway, this brought to mind beer bread, an incredibly easy and (relatively-speaking) 
QUICK bread that is super-yummy. Katie's mom made this on a regular basis using whatever beer she could find in the fridge (usually
Budweiser). We prefer to use a more flavorful beer like Shiner, Blue Moon, or Fat Tire as it just seems to give it a better flavor. However, 
use whatever beer you like. I'm sure it will be delicious!

## Ingredients 
1. 3 cups self-rising flour (the self-rising part is VERY important here)
1. 1/4 cup sugar
1. 1 can/bottle of beer
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray
1. a few pats of butter (to be used later in recipe)

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
1. Mix the flour, sugar and beer together in a mixing bowl.
1. Place dough in a greased loaf pan and bake for one hour.
1. After one hour, melt the butter and spread it over the top of the loaf generously.
1. Return loaf to oven and bake for another 20-30 minutes. YUM!
