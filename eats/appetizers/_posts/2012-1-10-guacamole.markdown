# Guacamole
I have a confession: I didn't even like guacamole when I met Scotty. In fact, it took him several years to get me to even try his guacamole, and even then it took me another few years to actually like it. Now, I love guacamole, 
particularly his. It's so simple to make and yet it has such amazing flavor. It's not filled with diced tomatoes, cilantro, etc. like a lot of guacamole you find in restaurants. It's very smooth and, depending on how much salsa 
you add, it has a nice little kick to it. The key to this recipe is finding a really HOT salsa because you don't want to use very much of it and you still want the flavor. There are no exact measurements for this recipe; it's more 
of a "what you like" kind of thing -- start out sparingly with each ingredient and just add until you find what you like. 

## Ingredients
1. 2-3 avocados, sliced, scooped, and de-seeded
1. an onion
1. garlic salt
1. El Fenix salsa (can be found at Albertson's and HEB) or some other HOT salsa

## Directions
1. On a cutting board or plate, mash the avocados with a fork until they are all nice and mixed up. 
1. Grate the onion using a cheese grater so that you get the juice to drip onto the mashed avocado. 
1. Add some garlic salt and a bit of El Fenix salsa and mix it all together. 
1. Continue adding onion juice, garlic salt and/or El Fenix until the desired flavor is reached.
