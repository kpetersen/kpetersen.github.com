# Jim's Killer Seasoning
I have no idea if I'll get in serious trouble for sharing this recipe or not, but here goes. I got this recipe from a dear, dear man whom I consider my family despite the lack of blood relation between us. Both he and his wife are
incredible cooks, and it was a treat growing up with them as my parents' best friends. At least once a month we would have dinner with them, and the adults would always make some new, incredibly delicious, several-course meal. I won't 
say that they were showing off to one another because that's not how it was; they were simply sharing their love for cooking scrumptious foods with people they loved. Jim sent me this recipe for a fabulously spicy seasoning, and I've
found that I use it in several of my favorite recipes. I realize that this recipe isn't really an appetizer, but I couldn't figure out where else to put it...

## Ingredients
1. 13 oz salt
1. 1 1/2 oz black pepper
1. 2 oz cayenne pepper
1. 1 oz pure garlic powder
1. 1 oz chili powder
1. 1/2 oz dry mustard

## Directions
1. Dump all of the above into a food processor and blend together, taking special care not to inhale the fine dust that will be created as you will sneeze for quite possibly the rest of your life. 
1. Store in an airtight container (I use a Ziplock tupperware thingy) and use on chicken, seafood, pork, vegetables, etc.
