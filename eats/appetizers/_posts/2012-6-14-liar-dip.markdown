# A Kind of Bean Salsa
This is an absolutely addicting dip that I've adapted from a dip my best friend's ex made up one day while watching the Food Network. 

## Ingredients
1. 1 can black beans, drained
1. 1 can HEB Green Chile Tomatillo Salsa
1. 1 can Ro-Tel (original)

## Directions
1. Combine the above ingredients into a bowl, stir, and refrigerate (as it is definitely better cold).
