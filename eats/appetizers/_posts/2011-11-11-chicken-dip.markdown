# Chicken Dip
Several years ago, Scott's whole family got together in Midland for Thanksgiving -- all of the cousins, aunts, uncles, grandma, etc. It was SO MUCH FUN! One of our cousins, Felicia, made this amazing chicken dip that I absolutely 
could not stop eating. It's served warm, and it is just delicious. You can serve it with Wheat Thins or your favorite cracker, but I think it goes best with Frito's. 

## Ingredients
1. 2 cans of chicken
1. 1 can cream of chicken soup
1. 1/2 can tomato soup
1. 1 cup mayonnaise
1. 12 oz cream cheese
1. 1 tsp garlic salt
1. 2 cups shredded cheese
1. Paprika (as a topping only)

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees.
1. Mix the above ingredients together in a casserole dish and sprinkle the top with paprika.
1. Bake until bubbly. (Honestly, I can't remember how long that takes... I think it's about 30 minutes, though. Keep an eye on it in the oven the first time. I'll make it here soon and update this so you will know for sure.)
