# Chicken Dip
Several years ago, Scott's whole family got together in Midland for Thanksgiving -- all of the cousins, aunts, uncles, grandma, etc. It was SO MUCH FUN! One of our cousins, Felicia, made this amazing chicken dip that I absolutely 
could not stop eating. It's served warm, and it is just delicious. You can serve it with Wheat Thins or your favorite cracker, but I think it goes best with Frito's. 

## Ingredients
1. 2 cans of chicken (I use the 12.5 oz cans of Swanson)
1. 1 can cream of chicken soup
1. 1/2 can tomato soup
1. 1 cup mayonnaise
1. 12 oz cream cheese
1. 1 tsp garlic salt
1. 2 cups shredded cheese
1. Paprika (as a topping only)

(For the record, I didn't use the cheese that's pictured below. I normally grab the Mexican blend cheese at HEB when baking because I think it melts best. I grabbed what I thought was the same thing at Target the other day and THANKFULLY
caught that while it is a Mexican blend cheese, it's pre-seasoned with taco seasoning! EWWW! So... I grabbed a bag of plain 'ole Cheddar cheese I had in the fridge and used that.)

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees.

1. Mix the above ingredients together in a mixing bowl using a hand-held mixer (otherwise you'll never break up the cream cheese and get it mixed in). Spread evenly in a casserole dish and top with Paprika.

1. Bake until bubbly: 25-30 minutes. (I sampled the dip before taking a picture, hence the obvious scoop out of the middle in the following picture.)
