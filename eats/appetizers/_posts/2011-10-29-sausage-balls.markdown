# Sausage Balls
While I don't normally like sausage, I can eat my weight in these sausage balls without thinking twice about it (at least until I 
step on the scale the following day and cry a little). Scott's mom makes these for her world-famous family brunch (along with the [Cinnamon
Pull-Apart Bread](http://worldsmyoyster.com/eats/breads/2011/10/26/cinnamon-bread.html)). I like to make up a batch of them and freeze them
(raw) on a tray. Once frozen, I stack them in ziplock baggies, squeeze the air out, and keep them for those nights when the neighbors all 
get together to play ping-pong and I want to take something yummy for snacks. Cooking directions for frozen sausage balls at the bottom 
of the page!

## Ingredients
1. 1 lb. sausage (I like to use Owen's)
1. 8 oz. shredded Cheddar cheese
1. 2 cups Bisquick mix

## Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees (if you're planning to cook immediately) 
1. Let the sausage get to room temperature as it mixes better.
1. Mix together the sausage, cheese, and Bisquick in a large bowl.
1. Drop by teaspoon on an ungreased cookie sheet.
1. Bake for 10-12 minutes (watch carefully as they can burn very quickly!!)

**If you have made the sausage balls and frozen them raw, follow these directions for baking:**

1. Place the sausage balls *still frozen* on a cookie sheet and place them in the oven.
1. Ste the oven temperature to 400 degrees and let it heat up with the sausage balls in there. 
1. The sausage balls need to be in the oven for a total of 10-12 minutes (including heat-up time) -- remember to watch carefully
as the balls can burn quickly.
