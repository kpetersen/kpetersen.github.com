# Salsa
Mmmm, chips and salsa. It's a Texas staple, and there are so many different (and wonderful) salsas out there. This particular one has a lot of cilantro, which we happen to love. It's also quite easy to make (a theme among my many 
recipes) and keeps nicely in the fridge for about a week...assuming it will last that long!

## Ingredients
1. 6-8 Roma tomatoes, chunked (I usually cut them into 6-8 pieces each, depending on how big they are)
1. 1 tomatillo, cut into 4-6 pieces
1. 4 cloves of garlic
1. 1 bunch of green onions, coarsely chopped up to the splits
1. 1 jalapeno, seeds removed, coarsely chopped
1. 1 bunch of cilantro (leafy halves only -- just cut the stems off and you're good to go. It's ok if the leafy stems are there)
1. juice of 1/2 lime

## Directions
1. Add the first six ingredients to a food processor in the order in which they are listed. 
1. Squeeze the lime half over everything. 
1. Vigorously chop/blend the veggies together in the food processor until everything is finely chopped and blended.
