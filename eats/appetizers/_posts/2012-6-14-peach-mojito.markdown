# Peach Mojitos
Nothing says summer like peaches, and when I am not adding them to ice cream or [cobbler](http://worldsmyoyster.com/eats/desserts/2012/01/10/peach-cobbler.html), I like to add them to a bit of rum and mint. Mmm. A delightful 
summer adult treat!

## Ingredients
1. 1 pound of peaches, coarsely chopped with skins removed
1. 1 tsp lime zest
1. 1 cup fresh lime juice (about four large limes)
1. 3/4 cup sugar
1. 1/2 cup packed mint leaves
1. 2 cups white rum
1. 4 cups club soda, cold

## Directions
1. Place the peaches in a blender and process until smooth. 
1. Press the peach puree through a strainer into a bowl, discarding solids. 
1. In a pitcher, combine the lime zest, lime juice, sugar and mint and muddle using a muddler if you have one (or the back of a spoon if not). 
1. Add the peach puree and rum to the pitcher, stirring until the sugar dissolves. 
1. Stir in club soda. Serve!
