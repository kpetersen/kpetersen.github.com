# Asparagus Wraps
I finally found a way to get Scotty to eat asparagus!!! In all seriousness, this asparagus dish is fabulous finger-food and tastes
even better. It's really easy, can be prepared ahead (though you should serve the wraps right after you cook them), and it gets some
pretty healthy veggies in your guests' tummies!

## Ingredients
1. 1 bunch of asparagus, washed and trimmed 
1. about 1/2 lb of proscuitto, slided on the 1" slice at the deli
1. spreadable goat cheese (1 little tube of it will suffice)
1. olive oil
1. High-heat PAM or other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Spread a thin layer of goat cheese on each slice of proscuitto.
1. Cut each slice of meat in half (hamburger, not hot-dog style) so that each deli slice will make two bundles.
1. Rub a bit of olive oil over the cheese.
1. Roll three spears of asparagus in each piece of meat and place the bundles seam-side down on a tray. (The goat cheese should 
keep them together but it's better to be safe than sorry.)
1. Spray your grill with PAM and place the bundles directly on the grill.
1. Cook the bundles over medium-low heat, directly over the flames, for about fifteen minutes (until the asparagus gets limp). YUM!
