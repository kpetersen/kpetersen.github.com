# Hot Crackers
Several years ago, Katie attended a New Year's Day party and, as usual, grazed her way through the afternoon at the food stations. In
one fairly plain bowl, she discovered a small slice of appetizer heaven: hot crackers. By the looks of them, they aren't much; at first
taste, your mind will blow. There is so. much. flavor. packed into each little, tiny cracker. They are great for parties, football
game-watching afternoons, or for a quick mid-day snack. The trick is to see if you can not eat them all in one sitting!

## Ingredients
1. 1 box of saltine crackers or oyster crackers
1. 1 pkg Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix (the powder)
1. 1 1/3 cup canola oil
1. 2 Tbsp crushed red pepper

## Directions
1. Put the crackers in a bowl with a lid. (I like my big tupperware for this.)
1. Mix the dressing mix, canola oil, and red pepper together in a small bowl. Pour over crackers.
1. With the lid secured nicely, gently shake/roll the crackers until they are evenly coated. ENJOY!!!!
