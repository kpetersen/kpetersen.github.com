## Mini Quiche
We don't really go to or throw a lot of parties, but I am always thinking about what I would serve if I were to host a bruch/luncheon-style
bridal or baby shower (as my friends and are I getting to "that age" in our lives). Because I love quiche, I was determined to come up
with a recipe for individually-sized treats that the majority of people would like. This meant including a little bit of eveything in
them. This particular recipe makes a boatload of mini-quiche; in fact, you can make 16 mini-quiche and still have enough filling leftover
to make a full-sized quiche as well. It's PERFECT for parties!! (And the quiche can be made ahead, which is always nice.)

## Ingredients
1. 3 boxes of Pillsbury pie crusts (6 crusts in all) -- assuming you want to make a bunch of minis...and honestly, you might need four boxes... I can't remember.
1. 4 beaten eggs
1. 1 1/2 cups milk
1. 1/4 tsp salt
1. 1/8 tsp black pepper
1. Dash of ground nutmeg
1. Half of a pre-cooked hamsteak
1. 1 big green bell pepper
1. 1 really big tomato, or two smaller ones
1. 1 small can chopped green chilies
1. 1 bunch of green onions
1. 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese (I like HEB's Mexican-blend)
1. 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour.
1. PAM or some other non-stick spray

## Directions
1. Cut the pie crusts with a 3" cookie cutter (or glass tumbler) in such a way that you get eight rounds from each crust.

1. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.
1. Chop the ham, bell pepper, onion, and tomato together in your food processor until nicely shredded. (You can, of course, chop it all by hand but that takes forever!) Set aside.
1. In a small bowl, toss together the cheese and the flour. Set aside.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the veggies and the ham. Add the cheese and flour mixture and mix well (I like to use my hand mixer for this).

1. Grease your muffin cups and gently press a dough circle into each cup. Fill -- almost to the top but not quite -- each mini pie crust with the quiche filling.

1. Bake for 12-14 minutes (until a pick inserted near the middle comes out clean). Let stand for a few minutes before popping out of tins and eating.

**You can turn this into a full-sized quiche by baking at 325 degrees for 40-45 minutes (again, until a pick inserted in the middle comes out clean). You might need to add a 
pie crust cover after about 15 minutes to keep the top crust from burning.**
