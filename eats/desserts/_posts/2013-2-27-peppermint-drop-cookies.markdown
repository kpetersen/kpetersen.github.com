# Peppermint Chocolate Chip Drops
My brother used to make these cookies all of the time when were were kids. (This was before I discovered the joys of cooking, so I watched owlishly and then 
just ate whatever he made.) These are incredibly easy with very few ingredients, and they are absolutely delicious. The cookies seriously melt in your mouth. 
YUM!

## Ingredients 
1. 2 egg whites, room temperature
1. 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
1. 1/2 cup sugar
1. 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
1. 1/4 cup finely crushed hard peppermint candies

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 250 degrees. 
1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cream of tartar with the egg whites and beat at high speed until soft peaks begin to form. 
1. Add the sugar, a little bit at a time, while continuing to beat at high speed. Beat until stiff peaks form. 
1. Fold in the chocolate chips and candies gently. 
1. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto a parchment-paper lined cookie sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until dry and starting to slightly brown on the tops. 
1. Cool completely before trying to remove from the baking sheets.
