# Chocolate Souffle
I found [this](http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2012/02/06/rise-to-the-occasion-with-homemade-chocolate-souffle/) recipe for a chocolate soufflé on CNN.com's [Eatocracy](http://eatocracy.cnn.com/?hpt=ea_ea)
and had to give it a try. You can read all about our kitchen experiment (complete with pictures) [here](). 

## Ingredients for Ramekins
1. 6 Ramekins (four-inch)
1. 1 Tbsp butter
1. Sugar
1. 6 dashes Gran Marnier

## Directions for Ramekins
1. Butter the insides of the ramekins.
1. Roll sugar around the insides of the ramekins so the sides and bottom are evenly coated. Knock out excess sugar.
1. Add one dash of Gran Marnier to the bottom of each ramekin. Set aside.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

## Ingredients for Chocolate Mixture
1. 1/2 cup sugar
1. 1/2 cup water
1. 1/2 cup extra-bitter cocoa powder
1. 3/4 Tbsp butter, melted
1. vanilla extract
1. salt (couple of pinches)
1. 2 dashes Gran Marnier

## Directions for Chocolate Mixture
1. In a pot, bring sugar and water to a boil; allow to cool.
1. Sift cocoa powder into syrup mixture.
1. Add melted butter, vanilla, Gran Mariner and salt; stir. Set aside.

## Ingredients for Egg Whites
1. 16 egg whites
1. Dash of cream of tartar
1. 6 Tbsp confectioners' sugar (powdered sugar)

## Directions for Egg Whites
1. In a large mixing bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar; beat until soft peaks form. 
1. Add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, taking care not to overbeat. 
1. In another large mixing bowl, add 1/3 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture (what you just made) and gently but quickly fold 
them in together. Add the next third and then the next, gently but quickly folding each in to the mixture. Make sure 
you get the chocolate mixture fully incorporated. DO NOT OVERFOLD as you'll lose the fluffiness of the egg whites 
and your soufflé won't rise!!
1. Divide this mixture evenly between the six ramekins; tap on the counter to settle and then wipe of any excess. 
1. Bake in oven for 20 minutes until puffed and golden. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN WHILE SOUFFLÉS ARE COOKING!!!
1. As soon as you remove the soufflés from the oven, you want to add the chocolate sauce and crème chantilly and serve, so 
make sure you have your chocolate sauce and crème ready to go when the soufflés are done. 

## Ingredients for Chocolate Sauce (to be made while souffles cook)
1. 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate
1. 1 Tbsp butter
1. 1 cup milk
1. 1 cup heavy cream
1. 1/4 cup sugar

## Directions for Chocolate Sauce
1. Melt chocolate with butter in a double boiler. 
1. In a separate pan, bring the milk, heavy cream and sugar to a boil.
1. Whisk milk, cream and sugar mixture into the chocolate, slowly incorporating each amount before adding more. 
1. As soon as the soufflés come out of the oven, gently prick open the top center of each and pour in some of 
the chocolate sauce. 

## Ingredients for Creme Chantilly (to be made while souffles cook)
1. 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1. 1 tsp sugar
1. 1 dash vanilla
1. fresh berries

## Directions for Creme Chantilly
1. Combine the first three ingredients in a bowl; beat until semi-stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat.
1. Place a dollop of crème on each souffle, over the hole into which you poured the chocolate sauce. 
1. Garnish with fresh berries if so desired and serve immediately.
