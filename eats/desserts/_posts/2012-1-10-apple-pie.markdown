# Apple Pie
Scotty's all-time favorite dessert is apple pie. He'll choose this over pretty much anything else that's being offered. I like this recipe over most others because of the topping. I don't much care for having a pie crust on both 
the top and bottom of my pie (even if it is a really good pie crust). I like a little variety in my food. The crumb topping on this pie literally melts in your mouth. 

## Pie Filling Ingredients
1. 6 Granny Smith (or equally tart) apples, peeled and either sliced or chopped
1. 3/4 cup sugar
1. 1 tsp cinnamon
1. 1/4 tsp salt
1. 1 Tbsp flour
1. 1 tsp lemon juice
1. 1 Tbsp butter
1. 1 pie crust, not pre-baked (I'll be honest: I use Pillsbury. I've yet to have a home-made pie crust turn out well.)

## Crumb Topping Ingredients
1. 6 Tbsp butter, cut into pieces
1. 1 tsp salt
1. 6 Tbsp sugar
1. 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp flour (or 18 Tbsp if you don't want to dirty up two things!)
1. Directions: Mix together in the food processor until a nice, crumby mixture has formed. 

## Directions
1. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. 
1. In a large bowl, mix all of the pie filling ingredients and place in a pie dish that's been lined with a pie crust. 
1. Top with the crumb topping mixture. 
1. Bake for 40-45 minutes.
