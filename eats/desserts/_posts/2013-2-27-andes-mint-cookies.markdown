# Andes Mint Cookies
A few days before Valentine's, Scotty and I were walking down the candy aisle (because we clearly enjoy tempting 
ourselves) and ran across a box of Andes Mints. Scotty looked at me and said, "Hey, do you think you could put 
these in some cookies?" I had an old recipe that I got from God-knows-where in my book, so I said, "Sure!" I'm 
not a huge fan of Andes Mints, but the husband loves them. He said these were the best cookies I've ever made. 
I did a Google search to see who came up with this recipe to give proper credit, but I found several people 
claiming to have it, so I really have no idea the origin. Either way, it's delicious. I prefer to use chocolate 
chips instead of Andes Mints, and both types have gotten rave reviews from friends and family lately. 

## Ingredients 
1. 1 stick butter, softened
1. 3/4 cup light brown sugar
1. 1/2 cup white sugar
1. 1 egg
1. 1 egg yolk
1. 1 tsp vanilla extract (I'm generous)
1. 3/4 tsp baking soda
1. 1 tsp baking powder
1. 1 tsp salt
1. 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1. 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1. 2 cups chopped Andes Mints or Andes Mints baking chips - OR 2 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350. 
1. With an electric stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugars on medium speed. Add the egg and egg yolk, 
mixing for about a minute after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract. 
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the baking soda, baking powder, salt, flour, and unsweetened cocoa powder. 
Add the dry ingredients by 1/4 cup full to the wet ingredients while mixing on low speed until all is combined.
1. By hand, fold in the Andes Mints (or chocolate chips). This will take a while, and you will get frustrated and 
think, "There is no way all of these will mix in to this dough," but I promise you, keep at it for several minutes 
and it will all combine nicely.  
1. Drop by round tablespoonfuls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or wax paper. Bake for ten minutes 
exactly and remove from oven. I like to gently whack each cookie with the back of a wooden spoon to flatten them 
out a bit, but Scotty thinks it's silly. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for two-three minutes and then transfer 
to a plate or wire rack to completely cool. Store covered.
