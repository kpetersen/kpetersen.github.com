# Aunt Nancy's Chocolate Pie
Do you have an Aunt Nancy? I do. If you don't, I strongly suggest you find one because mine was a terrific cook! One of my favorite
recipes of hers is this decadent chocolate pie that literally melts in your mouth. The only catch with this recipe is that you have to 
plan ahead: it has to be made the day before so it can set up overnight in the refrigerator. 

## Ingredients 
1. 16 large marshmallows
1. 4 plain Hershey chocolate bars
1. 1/2 cup milk (preferably not skim... 1% is okay though)
1. 1/2 pint whipping cream, whipped with a few spoons of sugar
1. Graham cracker pie shell (I like to use the "two extra servings" Keebler crust because the pie fits best in it)

## Directions
1. Melt the marshmallows, milk, and Hershey bars in a double boiler until fully melted and mixed together, stirring constantly.
1. Pour the melted chocolate mix into a bowl and place in fridge for about fifteen minutes, stirring every few minutes. You want
to bring it to room temperature.
1. Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, making sure they become completely mixed together.
1. Place the filling in the Graham cracker crust and chill overnight in the fridge.

**To serve: You can add whipped cream and/or chocolate shavings to the top of the pie for extra presentation points!**
