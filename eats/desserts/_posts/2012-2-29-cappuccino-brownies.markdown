#Cappuccino Brownies
When Scott and I were engaged, several of my mom's friends, knowing how much I love to cook, got together and threw me a recipe shower. 
It was SO much fun, and I left with several fabulous recipes that we use often. Eileen, whom I've referenced several times throughout 
my website as my mom's best friend and a fabulous cook (her husband gave me Jim's Killer Seasoning recipe, among others), made these 
delicious little desserts for the party and, because she's wonderful, gave me the recipe, too! They are scrumptious. The kicker is that 
you don't want to just make these because, as you might a cake or pie or something. You end up with a 13x9 pan of these rich, heavenly 
little desserts, and you don't really want a piece any bigger than about 1 inch X 1 inch. They are that rich. I like to make these for 
parties and holidays when a lot of people will be around to eat them. If I end up with a lot of leftovers, I simply make a lot of new 
friends when Scott takes them to work the next day! :) Also worth noting is that these brownies are fairly easy to make but there is a 
LOT of hurry-up-and-wait time in here. 

Note: The recipe Eileen gave me was hand-written on the recipe card that was sent out with the invitation to the party. For the longest 
time, I had no idea where this recipe originated. After searching around, I *think* that the actual, original place in which this recipe
was published was the [Gourmet Cookbook](http://www.hmhbooks.com/features/gourmet/brownie.shtml), edited by Ruth Reichl. If this is not 
correct, please let me know. 

## Ingredients for Brownie Layer
1. 8 oz. good bittersweet chocolate (NOT unsweetened), chopped
1. 12 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1. 2 Tbsp instant espresso powder, dissolved in 1 1/2 Tbsp boiling water
1. 1 1/2 cups sugar
1. 2 tsp vanilla extract
1. 4 large eggs
1. 1 cup all-purpose flour
1. 1/2 tsp salt

## Ingredients for Cream Cheese Layer
1. 8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1. 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1. 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1. 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. 1 tsp ground cinnamon

## Ingredients for Glaze Layer
1. 6 oz good bittersweet chocolate (NOT unsweetened), finely chopped
1. 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1. 1/2 cup heavy cream
1. 1 1/2 Tbsp instant espresso powder, dissolved in 1 Tbsp boiling water

## Directions for Brownie Layer
1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees. 
1. Butter and flour (I use PAM Baking) a 13x9 baking pan, knocking out excess flour if needed. 
1. Melt chocolate, butter, and espresso mixture in a double-boiler, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and cool for ten minutes. 
1. Whisk sugar and vanilla into chocolate mixture then add eggs, one at a time, whisking until batter is smooth. 
1. Stir in flour and salt until just combined. 
1. Spread the batter evenly in the 13x9 dish. Bake until a wooden pick or skewer inserted into the middle comes out with only a few 
crumbs adhering; 22 - 27 minutes. 
1. Cool completely in the pan on a cooking rack; at least two hours. 

## Directions for Cream Cheese Layer
1. Beat together cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. 
1. Sift in confectioners' sugar, then add vanilla and cinnamon and beat until mixture is well-combined. 
1. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over the cooled brownie layer. 
1. Refrigerate until firm; at least one hour. 

## Directions for Glaze Layer
1. Combine all ingredients in a double-boiler, stirring until chocolate and butter are melted and glaze is smooth. 
1. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally; about twenty minutes. 
1. Pour glaze over cream cheese layer, then spread evenly. 
1. Refrigerate brownies, covered with tin foil, until cold; at least three hours or overnight. 
1. When ready to serve: cut into small squares (I usually do 1" squares or maybe slightly larger) and remove from pan while still cold. 
Keep any unused brownies in the fridge. They will keep in a single layer, refrigerated and covered, for up to five days very nicely.
