A Doggy-licious Thanksgiving Feast
===================

This is what happens when I go to Target alone and the pharmacist asks me to return in five - seven minutes because my prescription isn't ready yet. With nothing to do, I began to wander the 
aisles aimlessly, trying to kill time so I didn't annoy everyone by returning too early and having to be sent away again. Then, I saw _it_, the most magnificent thing I'd seen at Target in a 
long, long time. It was a holiday dinner plate made completely out of dog toys. It had everything one needs for a Thanksgiving feast: a plush, squeaky turkey with rope legs, a squeaky dinner roll, a squeaky corn on the cob, 
a squeaky baked potato, and a rope vegetable (green beans? broccoli?), all neatly organized on a red frisbee plate. How freaking awesome is that?? At only $9.99, this baby was a steal. 
I couldn't, in good conscience, return home without it.

(Why, yes, I _did_ take the time to set the table with a placemat, wine glass, and napkin. Thank you for noticing!)

Needless to say, the boys loved their feast. Within a few minutes, each toy had been carefully inspected, squeaked, and carried out of the kitchen and into the living room. It's a good day 
in the Petersen house! :)
