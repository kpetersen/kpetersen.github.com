No Excuses
===================
What can I say to explain myself following a six-week absence from blogging? Nothing, really. Between out-of-town company, being out of town myself, and illnesses for both Scotty and me, I just haven't really had time to 
spend at the computer. Here's a brief re-cap of what's been going on in my (our) life:

1. Scott's parents bought a lake house. They've been in and out of town getting stuff going with the remodel and picking out furniture, etc., and we've been in and out of town helping them. It's been so much fun to be a part 
of helping them do this, almost as much fun as hanging out there this summer is going to be! :)

1. My little brother Robby is ENGAGED! That's right, people -- I'm gettin' me a seeeeeester. I couldn't be happier for the two of them. Elizabeth is a wonderful girl, and she makes Robby so incredibly happy. I can't wait for 
all of the wedding fun. I remember when Robby called me about two years ago to tell me he'd started dating someone. The phone conversation went something like this (*NOTE: Robby's name has been changed to Robb until 
Scott can fix the layout problem for setting up the conversation. That should be done sometime tonight, at which point I'll give my brother his full name back):

Katie
: "Hey, little brother, what's up?"

Robby 
: "Hey, can you meet me in Waco Thursday night for dinner?"

Katie
: (slightly concerned thinking something is wrong) "Uhh, sure. I guess. Is everything okay??"

Robby
: "Yeah. It's just that... see, I met a girl. Well, I've known her for a while, but we just started going out. And I really like her. We've been together for about two weeks now, and, well.. I was thinking the other day, crap! I really like this girl. I better find out if Katie likes her, 
too."

Katie
: "I can meet you tonight. Is that better?" (laughing)

I was thrilled beyond words that he would consider us meeting something so important that early in the relationship. Of course we met in Waco, and I genuinely liked Elizabeth from the beginning. I can't wait to drop the 
"future" from sister-in-law later this year! :)

I love these two so much!!!

1. My grandma tried to have a heart attack. Thankfully, she wasn't very good at it. I'm also grateful that my mom was with her when it happened, even though I know how incredibly traumatizing it was for my mom at the time. The doctors 
said that if my grandma hadn't been with my mom (or someone who could help her), she wouldn't have survived. Eeeek! Mom got her to the hospital, and the doctor put four stents in her circumflex artery. I went back "home" to 
see her and ended up staying for a week. We had a great time visiting; I really should call her more often than I do. She's doing really well now. Nanny says she feels better than she has in a really long time. She's doing 
cardiac rehab and seems to be getting her strength back quite well. She did sell her car, though, which is probably for the better. She's been saying for a while now that she kind of wanted to stop driving. At 88, she felt 
like she just should be behind the wheel anymore. I think she was waiting for something to happen to make that decision for her. I hope that losing that independence won't be too hard for her... since it was her decision to 
stop driving and sell her car, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that she won't start to regret it. 

1. I got really, really sick. A front blew through while I was visiting my grandma, and my allergies went nuts. Because I couldn't keep my head open, I ended up with a nasty sinus infection and an even nastier ear infection, 
both of which required two different antibiotics before they finally went away. During my week spent on the couch because every time I stood up my ear filled up with nastiness and made me even more miserable, I became 
addicted to Draw Something on Scott's iPad. I'm now petitioning to get my own. It's kind of working... Anyway, below are a few of my "masterpieces." HA!

Did I mention that I've become totally addicted to this game and may have gotten slightly carried away?? :)

1. I've been working in the yard. I love springtime, and I'm really thankful that I didn't lose very many plants to last year's drought. I only lost a blackberry (that was only a year old) and some of my herbs. I've replanted 
both, plus a hibiscus and a new rose bush, and I've mulched the gardens. All I have left is to do something with the disaster that is the center garden in my backyard. We killed the ivy growth (on purpose!), so now I have 
to go in, clean it out, turn the soil, put down something to keep weeds, etc. from popping back up, and plant some new bushes. I think I want to do salvia. It's so pretty and, based on what I've seen around here, it's fairly 
resilient. Pictures to come soon...

1. A dear, dear friend from high school came to visit. Drew was in town for a conference, so we got to hang out with him for two nights. We had some fabulous BBQ at [County Line](http://www.countyline.com/), indulged in the roasted garlic bulb appetizer 
and fabulous entrees at [NXNW](http://nxnwbrew.com/), and spent hours here at the house catching up on each others' lives. It was wonderful. I only hope we don't go a year (or more) before we see each other again. 

1. Scott and I went to Fort Worth to visit family. We had a WONDERFUL time. We got to see Robby and Elizabeth, our Aunt Sualice and Uncle Ray, cousins Jimmy, Susan, Tammy, Darin, Easton, and Luke, and Elizabeth's parents. 
We also got to eat at [Joe T. Garcia's](http://joets.com/), which is arguably my most favorite place to eat in the DFW area. Seriously... try it if you're ever out there. YUM!

1. Scotty got sick. (No, I didn't give him what I had.) We *think* he had strep throat. His quick-strep was negative, but they aren't the most reliable tests in the world, so our doctor gave him an antibiotic to take just in case. 
Then, because that wasn't enough, he got a head cold. Poor guy. He's finally on the mend now, but it's been a rough chunk of days for him. I hate it when my hubby is sickly... And now, I'm sick again, this time with an upper-respiratory infection. Wheeee. This 
is all getting to be a bit ridiculous. 

Needless to say, we've been quite busy. Hopefully, now that life is a bit less hectic, I will update my website more regularly. I need to add some more recipes anyway....
