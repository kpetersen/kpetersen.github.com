Party in Slow Motion
===================
We spent last weekend at the lake house that Scott's parents bought earlier this year and completely re-did. The house is gorgeous, a testament to the excellent taste my in-laws have when it comes to decorating a home, even if I do give them a 
hard time for making it too fancy for a lake house. Although the house is lovely, my favorite place is out on the patio or the deck (depending on the time of day). There is a lovely breeze that blows right up the cove most of the time, 
and I've found that it really makes the otherwise awful heat quite tolerable. Of course, there is always the added bonus of being able to jump into the lake if and when I do get hot. Grant discovered that we can jump off the neighbors' 
docks with our [Sit 'n Floats](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OV0X4S/ref=asc_df_B000OV0X4S2052471?smid=A3BFTJF7TA5CPX&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=asn&creative=395129&creativeASIN=B000OV0X4S&hvpos=1o4&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6301643011048671890&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=)
and let the current take us back to our own dock. It's pretty amazing. I just don't see how anyone can be unhappy when they are at the lake. I've also gotten over my fear of walking around in a swimming suit, though I'm still undecided on whether or not that's actually a good thing. Ha! 
Roger and Turbo think the lake is the grandest thing ever... all except for the actual lake part. HA! The boys HATE, HATE, HATE the water. Turbo will sit with me on a float, but he really doesn't enjoy it, I don't think. Roger runs 
away if he even suspects that someone is going to try to coerce him into the water. Aside from that, though, the boys really do love the lake. They've befriended the neighbors, set up camp on the patio and the deck, LOVE the boat, 
and Turbo has his spot on the back of a living room chair already selected. Frankly, I'm quite relived that the boys have taken to lake living so well. I will admit to being quite nervous at first because there is no fenced-in yard
in which they can play; everything is wide-open. I didn't really want to have to keep the boys tied up all of the time, so the fact that they are proving to be well-behaved dogs despite me makes me incredibly happy. :) 

Here are a few pictures from the lake that Scott's mom has taken. I, naturally, have not remembered my camera YET, but that's going to change very, very quickly.

The boat, which I've named *Party in Slow Motion.*

Proof that I got up on skis, even if I did fall on my face immediately after this picture was taken. I. Got. Up!
