Pimpin' Our New Ride
===================

After months of research, discussion, and weighing the pros and cons, Scott and I traded in our Ladybug for a Ford Explorer. We finally decided it was time for a bigger, 
more comfortable/roomier car (especially Scott -- he never was comfortable riding in the Rogue for more than about half an hour), and we couldn't be happier with our decision. 
I am going to miss Ladybug; I get very emotionally attached to my cars. I actually teared up while cleaning her out for the last time. However, I do love this new car, and I 
believe that it won't take long for us to become emotionally involved as well. Here are some pictures of our new ride:

Pretty, huh? Here are some shots of the inside:

Anyway, we still haven't come up with a new name for her. Any suggestions?
