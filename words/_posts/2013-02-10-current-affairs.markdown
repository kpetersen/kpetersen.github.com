There is nothing sacred in my family. Nothing. We live with the theory
that if you can’t laugh about everything, you should probably stay far,
far away from us. Last night I was discussing current affairs with my
dad and brother, and here are some snippets from our conversation:

Daddy: A helicopter crashed in California while filming a reality show. How’s that for reality? 
Me: Yes, I saw that. Irony. It’s the opposite of wrinkly, which I’d imagine that chopper is now. 
Daddy: You’re a sicko. 

on the Grammys:
Me: What the hell is Adele wearing?
Scott: Was that once a couch?
Robby: OMG! She looks like an oriental rug.  

Me: Rihanna looks like she is seizing on stage.
Robby: She keeps saying, “Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay” and all I can think is, “Gooooooooooooo.”
Me: Seriously. Where’s Grumpy Cat when you need it?

Robby: Carrie Underwood needs to stop screaming at me.
Me: What’s happening to her dress?
Robby: And why is her dress molding? I have a lot of questions.
Me: And not a lot of answers….

Me: A sitar virtuoso. You don’t see a lot of those.
Me: Oh! And a cuatro virtuoso, too. Impressive.
Robby: Man, a lot of people went six feet under last year. 

Me: Oh, that’s nice. Zac Brown is looking considerably less Amish now.
Robby: Have you seen Amish Mafia?
Me: No? I thought the Amish were a peaceful people.
Robby: No. Apparently they are a very cut-throat society. Er, cut-beard, it turns out. AHAHAHAHA. 

a tirade on the guy covering “Your Song”
Robby: Elton John is freaking there
Robby: let him sing his own song
Robby: someone needs to tell this guy to gtfo the stage
Robby: this sucks
