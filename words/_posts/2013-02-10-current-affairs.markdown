title: on Current Affairs
---

There is nothing sacred in my family. Nothing. We live with the theory
that if you can’t laugh about everything, you should probably stay far,
far away from us. Last night I found myself discussing current affairs with my
dad and brother. Here is a snippet from one our conversations:

Daddy
: A helicopter crashed in California while filming a reality show. How’s that for reality? 

Me
: Yes, I saw that. Irony. It’s the opposite of wrinkly, which I’d imagine that chopper is now. 

Daddy
: You’re a sicko. 

Then our conversation turned toward the Grammys, at which point Daddy bowed out as he was being forced to 
watch (his words, not mine) <i> Hello, Dolly! </i> by the female parental unit. Here are some highlights from 
my conversation with Robby.

on Adele's choice of clothing:

Me
: What the heck is Adele wearing?

Scott
: Was that once a couch?

Me
: Yes, I think I saw it at a flea market not long ago.

Robby
: OMG! She looks like an oriental rug.  

on Rihanna's repeated stage performances:

Me
: Rihanna looks like she is seizing on stage.

Robby
: She keeps saying, “Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay” and all I can think is, “Gooooooooooooo.”

Me
: Seriously. Where’s Grumpy Cat when you need it?

on whatever the heck was happening to Carrie Underwood's dress during her performance:

Robby
: Carrie Underwood needs to stop screaming at me.

Me
: What’s happening to her dress?

Robby
: And why is her dress molding? I have a lot of questions.

Me
: And not a lot of answers….

on the lovely tribute to those who passed on in 2012:

Me
: A sitar virtuoso. You don’t see a lot of those.

Me
: Oh! And a cuatro virtuoso, too. Impressive.

Robby
: Man, a lot of people went six feet under last year. 

on Zac Brown's head adornments:

Me
: Oh, that’s nice. Zac Brown is looking considerably less Amish now, receiving this award.

Robby
: Have you seen Amish Mafia?

Me
: No? I thought the Amish were a peaceful people.

Robby
: No. Apparently they are a very cut-throat society. Er, cut-beard, it turns out. AHAHAHAHA. Did you see homeboy got 
fifteen years for his little beard-cutting gang activities? 

Me
: Haters gon' hate. 

and finally, a tirade on the guy covering “Your Song”:

Robby
: Elton John is freaking there

Robby
: let him sing his own song

Robby
: someone needs to tell this guy to gtfo the stage

Robby
: this sucks

<br/>
Cheers, y'all! :)
