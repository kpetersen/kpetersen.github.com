An Exercise Update
===================
In my [first](http://worldsmyoyster.com/words/2011/10/24/this-body-was-not-made-for-running.html) blog entry on this website, I chronicled my 
experience starting the Couch to 5K program. If you remember, it did not go well, presumably because I took the boys with me for my first run. 
I continued with the program for several weeks, faithfully running three to four times a week in my neighborhood and building up a decent 
stamina (for me, at least). Then I got sick and had to stop running for several weeks. Immediately following that was the holiday season, during 
which I had so much to do that running just fell by the wayside. Incidentally, I found myself looking 2012 in the eye without having run for the 
previous two months. EEEEEK! 

I was determined to get myself in better shape in the new year both by exercising regularly and bettering my eating habits. I began a detailed food diary, and I was just 
about to start running again when a dear friend posted a blog entry about nearly being carjacked at gun point (she was able to get away safely with both 
of her children, thank God) in her own neighborhood. Then the local news began reporting on the upcoming anniversary of the abduction of a Georgetown 
girl several years ago while out for a run. And then, to top things off, I got stalked at the grocery store by Mr. Creepy McCreeperson himself. All of this 
happened within the period of about five days. Needless to say, I was incredibly wary of running in my neighborhood by myself. I decided that I would 
focus on things I could do within the safety of my own home. An added perk of this decision was that I didn't have to deal with the guilt I felt every 
time I walked out the front door in tennis shoes, leaving the boys behind with them knowing exactly what I was going to do. Their pathetic cries of, 
"How can you go for a walk without us???" nearly brought me to tears every day anyway. I spent my Christmas money on an exercise mat, two ten-pound 
free-weights, a pilates bar, and one of those big exercise balls. (I also bought a pair of boots, but that's for another time.) Since then, I've made a point of exercising in the living room three to four times a 
week. It's going very well, and I'm starting to see some definition in my tummy, legs and arms. YAY!!! Now my biggest problem is the fact that Turbo likes to come sit 
on my chest while I'm trying to do crunches and Roger tries to curl up under my legs every time I lift them... 

With regard to better eating, I've hung my new swim suit in the pantry as a deterrent to snacking. So far, it's working quite well. Instead of peanut butter, I now
reach for raw veggies and hummus. Instead of cookies, I grab a wedge of Laughing Cow cheese and multi-grain pita chips. Speaking of, have you tried the Laughing Cow cheeses? 
They are absolutely amazing. One of my friends says that the secret to their deliciousness is crack, and I think he's right. YUM! Of course, I'm not denying myself
yumminess completely. I don't believe that's an effective way to do anything. My grandpa always said, "Everything should be consumed in moderation. Except tobacco and illegal drugs. You 
should always avoid those at all cost!" I agree with him completely. Tonight, we had pizza for dinner. I do love me some cheese pizza! My weakness this time of year 
tends to be Girl Scout cookies. I can proudly say I've yet to eat a single one this year, though I have to confess a lot of that has to do with the fact that I haven't actually 
run into any Girl Scouts selling cookies this year. I think it's because I've made a conscious effort NOT to shop in the evenings or on the weekends, thus greatly 
reducing the chance of me running into the girls. As a former Girl Scout, I lack the ability to say "no" to those earnest young hands shoving a box of Caramel Delights (work 
with me -- that's what they were called when I was selling them) at me as I walk out of Lowe's. 

So there you have it. I hate that I did not ever get up to a 5k with my running, but one of these days I plan to purchase a treadmill (if I can ever figure out where to 
store it in our house!) and hopefully I'll be able to restart the program at that time. Until then, I am just going to stick with the things I can do without having to 
worry about my safety. :)
