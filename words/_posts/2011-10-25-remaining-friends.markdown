The Art of Designing a Website While Remaining Friends With Your Spouse
===================

The conversation went something like this:

Katie
: "Hey, hon?"

Scott
: "Yeah?" (he was a poor, unsuspecting soul)

Katie
: "I'm sick of my Blogger site. I want a new blog."

Scott
: "Uh, huh. So get a different blog."

Katie
: "Well, you see... here's the thing. I kind of came up with a design I really want and I can't find anywhere that will let me
use it."

Scott
: "Oooookaaaaaayyyyyyy. Let's have a look."

Thus began our journey into creating our very own -- and very first -- website (for those of you wondering, yes... it's this 
one you're visiting right now). We (and by we I completely mean Scott) decided to use Github to host our site and Jekyll for the 
programming. From there, it was a lot of this:

Katie
: "I want it higher."

Scott
: "You want what higher?"

Katie
: "That! (pointing) Oooh, and can you rotate it? That would look neat!"

Scott
: "Rotate it? Woman, are you trying to kill me here?"

and this...  
(Scott had spent quite a bit of time getting all of the layouts to fit nicely with the font I'd picked)

Katie
: "You know... I don't think I like that font. Can we try a different one?"

Scott
: "Seriously??? (audible sigh) What font do you want?"

and this... 

Katie
: "I want a dropshadow on that."

Scott
: "I can't do the kind of dropshadow you want in this program. You'll have to do that in PhotoShop."

Katie
: "I've never done anything like that in PhotoShop."

Scott
: "Well, if you want a dropshadow, you'd better figure it out." (followed by an evil cackle and a silly face... ok, no cackle, but he definitely stuck his tongue out at me!)

...a few days later...

Katie
: "HEY! Guess what??"

Scott
: "HEY! What?"

Katie
: "I added a dropshadow to the shells. We can now get rid of the starfish and add the shells. It just makes more sense for a site called "World's My Oyster" to have oyster shells with pearls instead of dancing starfish. Right?"

Scott
: "Yep. Okay." -- sits down to do it and breaks the whole dang site

Katie
: "AHHHHHHHHHHH! That is NOT what I wanted!!"

Scott
: "I know, I know... calm yourself. I can fix it."

Katie
: "Uh, huh... you bettah..." (complete with sticking out tongue because he did that to me earlier)

and this...

Katie
: "What are you doing?"

Scott
: "I'm trying to figure out how to center the tabs at the top. You know, Home, Words, Eats, etc."

Katie
: "Noooooooooooooo. I don't want them centered. I like them a little wonky, there off to the side."

Scott
: "I want them centered. They'll look better."

Katie
: "It will look like my website has buck teeth. Is that really what you want, a buck-toothed website?" (proceeds to pretend to have really bad buck teeth and starts talking to Scott)

Scott
: (laughing at my ridiculous face) "It will NOT look like it has buck teeth. It will look cleaner, cripser...more organized." (I don't think those were his exact words, but his words were definitely to that effect)

Katie
: "It will look like it has buck teeth. That is final."

Scott
: "Fine. Then you're going to have a website with buck teeth. I'm doing the programming, and I like it centered."

Katie
: "Fiiiinnnnneeeeee." (along with an exasperated sigh)

and this...

Scott
: (reading the Creds page) "I didn't know we had a pet dragon."

Katie
: "Mmmhmmm."

Scott
: "Where is this pet dragon?"

Katie
: "Oh, you know... around."

Scott
: "Oh, really?"

Katie
: "Yup. It's better not to ask questions."

Scott
: "I _like_ it."

and a LOT of this as I became "better" at programming...

Katie
: "Uh, Scotty??? I broke it."

Scott
: "Broke what?"

Katie
: "Whatever I was trying to do." (points to a lot of error messages on the screen)

Scott
: "Ah, yes you did. Good job!"

Katie
: "Is it fixable?" (with her very best guilty grin)

Scott
: "Yeah. Scoot over a bit and let me see what I can do."

Somehow, we managed to find a middle ground on everything (except the buck teeth) and end up with what we think is a pretty spiffy site.
We are still playing with it, still learning the ins and outs of web design, but it's not a bad start. I'm learning more each day about
this programming business, and Scotty is really enjoying the challenges that web design programming is offering compared to the programming
he does on a daily basis. Plus, it's fun having a project with which we *both* enjoy playing! We have some plans lined up for the site, first up being organizing the recipes and adding a place for comments on the blog
and on the recipes. Once comments are up and running (hopefully very soon!), please let us know if there's some way we can make the website even better. 
As I have said before, this is a first for us! :)
