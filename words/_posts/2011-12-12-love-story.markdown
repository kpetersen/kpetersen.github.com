The Second Greatest Love Story of All
===================
"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and
not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; 
for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.' Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the 
Lord through the prophet: 'BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,' which translated means, 'GOD IS WITH US.' And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of 
the Lord commanded him, and took _Mary_ as his wife, but he kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus" (Matthew 1: 18-25).

I think it's safe to assume that most people are, at the very least, familiar with the story of Jesus' birth. There was no room in the inn; Mary gave birth to a baby boy in a manger and named Him Jesus; three wise men traveled 
from afar to bring gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the newborn King; there was a star that shepherds could see from miles and miles away, announcing the birth of Jesus, the Child sent to save us from our sins. I can 
imagine no greater love than for a father to sacrifice his only son so that we -- you and I -- could have everlasting life. That is the greatest love story of all. 

What about that day, nine months before, when Mary had to tell Joseph, the man to whom she was engaged, the man whom 
she had never touched, that she was pregant? Put yourself in her shoes for a moment. You're sitting there, all alone, 
when a man appears to you, wearing white robes and a halo over his head, and tells you that you're going to have a 
child, even though you're still a virgin, because "you have found favor with God" (Luke 1:30). What?! Even Mary wanted 
to know "[h]ow shall this be, since I have no husband?" (Luke 1:34). Gabriel, the angel, told Mary not to worry, that 
the Holy Spirit would come upon her and create the child, reminding her that "with God, nothing will be impossible" 
(Luke 1:37), and what was Mary's response? "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your 
word" (Luke 1:38). In other words, she said okay, let's do this thing. Now that is faith in its truest form. While 
history has probably romanticized at least somewhat the whole virgin-on-your-wedding-night thing, getting pregnant before you were 
married was not looked upon with favor. In fact, society generally ostracized a person for it. Mary had no reason
to believe that an honorable man such as Joseph would stand by her side once he learned about her situation. 
Would you believe your fiancee if she came to you and said she was pregnant, expecting you to believe 
that it was God's doing, to believe that she had not been with another man? Yet that's exactly what happened. She simply 
believed that Joseph would trust her, believe her when she told him what happened and believe that she wouldn't ever lie to him. It definitely helped that Gabriel, 
the angel, appeared to Joseph and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his 
people from their sins" (Matthew 1:20-21). Still, Joseph didn't have to believe Mary _or_ Gabriel. He did because 
he had faith in both God and Mary, and he trusted both of them completely. He took Mary as his wife, 
loved her completely, raised Jesus as his own son, and went on to have several other children with his beloved. No 
questions, just faith, trust, and love. What an amazing love story! This makes Prince Charming and Cinderella look like they 
didn't even know what they were doing. 

I pray that I have a Mary-and-Joseph kind of relationship with my husband, the kind where our love for one another is made whole by 
our absolute faith and trust in one another. The kind where our center is God, and, because of that, there are no questions. 
If ever there was a standard for marriage, I believe that Mary and Joseph set it with their love story, the second greatest 
one of all.
