The Art of Designing a Website While Remaining Friends With Your Spouse
===================

The conversation went something like this:
Katie - "Hey, hon?"
Scott (aka poor unsuspecting soul) - "Yeah?"
Katie - "I'm sick of my Blogger site. I want a new blog."
Scott - "Uh, huh. So get a different blog."
Katie - "Well, you see... here's the thing. I kind of came up with a design I really want and I can't find anywhere that will let me
use it."
Scott - "Oooookaaaaaayyyyyyy. Let's have a look."

And thus began our journey into creating our very own -- and very first -- website (for those of you wondering, yes... it's this 
one you're visiting right now). We (and by we I completely mean Scott) decided to use Github to host our site and Jekyll for the 
programming. From there, it was a lot of this:

K- "I want it higher."
S - "You want what higher?"
K - "That! (pointing) Oooh, and can you rotate it? That would look neat!"
S - "Rotate it? Woman, are you trying to kill me here?"

and this...

{Scott has spent quite a bit of time getting all of the layout to fit nicely with the font I've picked}
K - "You know... I don't think I like that font. Can we try a different one?"
S - "Seriously??? (audible sigh) What font do you want?"

and this...

K - "I want a dropshadow on that."
S - "I can't do the kind of dropshadow you want in this program. You'll have to do that in PhotoShop."
K - "I've never done anything like that in PhotoShop."
S - "Well, if you want a dropshadow, you'd better figure it out." (followed by an evil cackle and a silly face... ok, no cackle, but he definitely stuck his tongue out at me!)
...a few days later...
K - "HEY! Guess what??"
S - "HEY! What?"
K - "I added a dropshadow to the shells. We can now get rid of the starfish and add the shells. It just makes more sense for a site called "World's My Oyster" to have oyster shells with pearls instead of dancing starfish. Right?"
S - "Yep. Okay." -- sits down to do it and breaks the whole dang site
K - "AHHHHHHHHHHH! That is NOT what I wanted!!"
S - "I know, I know... calm yourself. I can fix it."
K - "Uh, huh... you bettah..." (complete with sticking out tongue because he did that to me earlier)

and this...

K - "What are you doing?"
S - "I'm trying to figure out how to center the tabs at the top. You know, Home, Words, Eats, etc."
K - "Noooooooooooooo. I don't want them centered. I like them a little wonky, there off to the side."
S - "I want them centered. They'll look better."
K - "It will look like my website has buck teeth. Is that really what you want, a buck-toothed website?" (proceeds to pretend to have really bad buck teeth and starts talking to Scott)
S (laughing at my ridiculous face) - "It will NOT look like it has buck teeth. It will look cleaner, cripser...more organized." (I don't think those were his exact words, but his words were definitely to that effect)
K - "It will look like it has buck teeth. That is final."
S - "Fine. Then you're going to have a website with buck teeth. I'm doing the programming and I like it centered."
K - "Fine!!!" (along with an exasperated sigh)

and this...

S (reading the Creds page) - "I didn't know we had a pet dragon."
K - "Mmmhmmm."
S - "Where is this pet dragon?"
K - "Oh, you know... around."
S - "Oh, really?"
K - "Yup. It's better not to ask questions."
