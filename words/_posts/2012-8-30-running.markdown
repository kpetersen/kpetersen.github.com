5k? I'd Settle for 5 Minutes!
===================

Yep. That pretty much sums up the running experience for me, haha. In all seriousness, having failed my prior 
attempt at completing the [Couch to 5k Program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/index.shtml), I picked 
it back up with my neighbor a little more than a month ago. Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts have forced us to continue 
the program on our own, which stinks because I have learned that I really need a motivator to run WITH me. I've 
talked my dad into doing the program, though, so at least we can text each other our results each day. Today 
went something like this:

Dad: "2.39 miles in 31 minutes. Not so good. Should be more like 2.6 miles."

Katie: "I quit after nearly puking in some random dude's yard. I made it through the first two run sessions then couldn't go on. I 
hit "quit" and walked home. 

Today was week four, day one. I have five more weeks of this before I'll be ready to run a 5k. This is assuming I 
can make it through a five-minute jog. I am not entirely convinced my body was made for running. I am, however, 
determined to see this through. My immediate goal is to make it through week four, day one tomorrow. My short-term
goal is to make it to week five, day three because my friend Doug has promised to do that two-mile run with me. 
Obviously my long-term goal is to run a 5k all the way through by December 31. Given that I should be finished with this 
program by mid-October at the latest, I feel that my goal is completely attainable. I just have to stay motivated...
