# Disney Vacation Book

As I said in my Alaska Book post, I'm learning my way around digital scrapbooking using [Heritage Makers](www.heritagemakers.com).
I wanted to try out several techniques I'd seen other people use in the vast template gallery that HM offers its members, so I
decided to make a book dedicated to the Disney trip I _know_ Scotty will take me on some day. I've never been to DisneyWorld or DisneyLand,
and I have always wanted to go. Maybe when we have kids of our own... 

Anyway, [HERE](http://www.heritagemakers.com/projectBrowserStandAlone.cfm?projectId=1926548&productId=9&projectSponsor=419825) is the link if you want to view my book!
