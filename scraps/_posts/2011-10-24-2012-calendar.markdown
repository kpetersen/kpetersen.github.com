# 2012 Planner

I love technology, but there's really nothing better than a nice, big planner for recording appointments, lunches, happy hours, visits
from family, vacations, and more. It's the one area in my life where I consistently find myself resistant to change. Don't get me wrong --
I definitely use iCal. It's so easy, especially because I can sync between my phone and my computer, but I still love having that hard-copy
calendar either stuffed in a (big) purse or sitting out on the counter. Because of this, I was inspired to make my own calendar for 2012. 
It's probably not the most economic calendar I've ever purchased, but I do have the satisfaction of knowing that I've decided on every
single element on every single page. For this particular link, I've deleted all of the birthdays I entered because I don't know that
my family and friends necessarily want me advertising their birthdays. But y'all don't worry -- I'll remember when the time comes 
because in the calendar I have, they are all there! :)
