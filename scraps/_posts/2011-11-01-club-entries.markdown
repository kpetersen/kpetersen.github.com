# Club HM (on Facebook) Daily Contest Entries

Every weekday, Club HM, the Heritage Makers Facebook page, issues a "daily challenge" contest complete with prizes. The themes vary, and the contests are usually pretty fun. 
Sometimes winners are chosen by the home office, and at other times, the winners are chosen by how many "likes" the project gets from other fans of the Club HM page. I don't 
enter every day because sometimes I don't know what to do, and at other times I don't have time, but here are some of the entries I've created so far. I'll add to this page 
when I make new entries that are worth putting up here. I haven't won yet, but I'm holding out hope...

Here's a 12X12" scrapbook page I made for a contest in which we had to use a picture we wouldn't normally use in a project. The big picture of Roger on this page is actually 
kind of blurry and not a particularly good picture. I still love his toothy grin, though!

Here's another 12X12" scrapbook page I made, this time for a contest in which we had to use a new art collection called "Happy, Happy Pengies."
