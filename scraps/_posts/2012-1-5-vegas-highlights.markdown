# Vegas Highlights Book

Scotty and I try to go to Las Vegas about once a year. It's a fun vacation that, for a resort-style place, really isn't all that expensive (at least as long as I stick to the penny slots). 
Even though I try to take pictures each time, I never end up with enough pictures to really justify a whole book. At the end of our last trip, as I was lamenting once again that I didn't have 
enough pictures even though I really wanted to make a book, Scotty suggested I make a highlights book using my favorite pictures from each of our trips. He's so brilliant; this is why I 
married him. So, here you have it... our Vegas Highlights book:
