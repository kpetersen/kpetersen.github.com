# Valentine's Day Card

This year, I decided to make my family Valentine's day cards. Because the cards were 
going to our parents, siblings, and aunt and uncle, I didn't want them to be mushy 
or lovey-dovey. I did, however, want them to convey love in the truest sense of the 
word. That being said, here's the card I made:

Back/Front

(PS: I really, really hate the huge Heritage Makers logo on the back of the folded 
cards. Unfortunately, at this point in time, there's nothing I can do about it. I'm 
keeping my fingers crossed that they'll make it optional if you pay a little more 
or something... because I will totally pay extra to get rid of it. It's so tacky!)

Inside
