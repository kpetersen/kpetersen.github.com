# Website project

Katie started the layout for this website in
[HeritageMakers](http://heritagemakers.com) as a 12"x12" scrapbook
page. From that, we first tried to create the website as a Google Sites
page. Scott got frustrated with the conflicts between that system and
Katie's design, so we decided to scratch-build the whole thing. Scott
picked [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the engine and
[Github](http://github.com) for hosting.  From there, Scott laid the
whole site out with plain HTML5 and CSS.
