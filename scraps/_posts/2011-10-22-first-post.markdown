# Website project

Frustrated by the limitations she faced with her Blogger site, Katie created the layout she wanted for a new website in
[HeritageMakers](http://heritagemakers.com) as a 12"x12" scrapbook
page. Using that design, we first tried to create the website as a Google Sites
page. Scott got frustrated with the conflicts between that system and
Katie's design, so we decided to scratch-build the whole thing. Scott
picked [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the engine and
[Github](http://github.com) for hosting.  From there, Scott laid the
whole site out with plain HTML5 and CSS.
