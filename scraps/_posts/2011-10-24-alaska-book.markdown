# Alaska Book

In August, Scotty and I had the unique opportunity to spend two weeks in Alaska and Canada with our family. Scott's parents
gave us this trip for Christmas last year, and we joined, alongside them, our aunt and uncle and Scott's brother on this 
unforgettable trip. We began our journey with a direct flight (thank God...I hate flying) to Anchorage, then proceeded to spend the 
first few days of our trip exploring interior Alaksa. We stayed at the [Mt. McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge](http://www.princesslodges.com/mckinley-lodge.cfm),
the [Denali Princess Lodge](http://www.princesslodges.com/denali-lodge.cfm), visited Talkeetna and Denali National Park, and rode the [Denali Express](http://www.princess.com/learn/destinations/alaska/why_visit_alaska/rail_service/index.html) all the
way back to the Whittier cruise terminal when we were ready to begin our cruise. Our cruise lasted seven days, and during those days
we saw Glacier Bay National Park (complete with glacier calving), killer whales swimming alongside our ship, visited Skagway, Juneau,
and Ketchikan, and had the opportunity to walk on glaciers and watch black bears fish for salmon from no more than twenty yards away. Then we spent
a few days in Canada where the guys went fishing, the girls toured Vancouver, and we all went out to Victoria Island where we got to
walk through the [Butchart Gardens](http://www.butchartgardens.com/) and visit downtown Victoria. 
As I said before, this trip was absolutely unforgettable.

Because I'm a scrapbooker at heart, there was no way I was going to pass up the chance to include at least some
of the 3700 pictures we took on this trip in an album to share with others. I've recently gotten into digital scrapbooking with
[Heritage Makers](www.heritagemakers.com), so I decided this would be the ideal project with which to start. I think it turned out
magnificently, but feel free to judge for yourself:
